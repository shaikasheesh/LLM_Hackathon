","#How to Choose a Career: 7 Ways to Narrow Your Options by Coursera



A career is the sum of your professional journey. Many people embark on a career because it can help them achieve their goals, such as acquiring more knowledge and experience, taking on more responsibility, or earning higher salaries.



But finding a career that best suits you takes time—and your career will likely shift throughout your working life. You may end up changing roles or industries as your interests, motivations, and needs change. One survey from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) found that those born between 1957 and 1964 held an average of 12.4 jobs between the ages of 18 and 54 [1]. Data from a separate survey conducted in 2020 found that people now stay in each job for around four years [2]. Those facts, combined with the growth of automation, the rise in gig employment, and even underemployment, suggest that careers evolve over time.



We’ve compiled seven ways to begin thinking about the best career options for you. These are tools and questions meant to structure your thought process, so you can determine what careers might suit you best—and help you achieve your goals.



The average person spends around one-third of their life working, so it’s no surprise that many people want to find a career that will be a good fit for them. Choosing a career first means learning as much as you can about yourself, your goals, and the larger context of work. Use the list below to help you begin that process.



What you enjoy doing and what you value can be helpful indicators about how you’d like to spend your working time. We’re not talking about finding and following your passion—that approach tends to be misleading and confusing. But it’s common to want to feel energized and even excited about what you do. Think over the following questions about your interests, values, and traits, and consider how you might answer them:



Interest-based questions:



What do you enjoy learning about?



How do you like to spend your time?



Do you enjoy manual labor or mental labor?



Do you enjoy working outside or inside?



Value-based questions:



What is most important in your life?



What are your priorities in life?



Where do you find meaning?



What change would you like to be a part of?



Trait-based questions:



What does success mean to you?



What do you want more of?



Which of your strengths do you enjoy the most?



Which of your skills are you most proud of?



Once you’ve put together a list about you, turn to your motivations for working. Perhaps you want a career that will pay a higher entry-level salary than comparable occupations, or one that promises more flexibility so you can work from anywhere. Most careers won’t feature everything you’d like, so it’s important to understand your priorities.



Below, we’ve detailed a sample priorities list. Think over what you’d include on your list and how you’d organize your priorities.



Salary



Benefits



Autonomy



Work/life balance



Flexibility



Career growth

What does your most perfect life look like? Make a list of your long-term goals, both personal and professional, to help you understand what it might take to reach them. For example: Do you want to rise past the managerial ranks and advance to the C-suite of a company? Do you want to own a house? Do you want to be able to travel—and how often?



The list you put together can also help you approach a job search more specifically. For example, if you want to work in the same industry 10 years from now, research which industries are poised to continue growing over the next decade and which to possibly avoid due to increasing automation or other factors.



Read more: What Are Your Career Goals? Tips for Setting Your Goals



There are a number of tests you can take to evaluate everything from your personality to your strengths—and even what career might be a good fit. But tests can be overly prescriptive, meaning they tend to impose categories on you. Rather than rely on them for a definitive answer, use them to continue learning more about yourself and your underlying motivations. If they present helpful answers, fold that knowledge into the larger picture you’re compiling.



Learning more about each sector and its respective goals may help you determine where you’d be a strong fit. Think about which goals sound most interesting to you.



Private: You’ll be employed through a privately owned company or corporation, which typically aims to increase growth and revenue.



Benefit: Greater potential for growth



Public: You’ll be employed through a local, state, or federal government, which aims to keep public programs and institutions operating.



Benefit: Greater potential stability



Non-profit: You’ll be employed through an organization not associated with private or public sectors, which is dedicated to addressing or fulfilling a public need. While it does not aim to make revenue the way private businesses do, it must earn enough to achieve its mission and cover overhead.



Benefit: Greater potential for meaning



Along with sectors, researching different industries may help you identify a few that could be a good fit. Search for established industries to see if any seem worth investigating further. (In the US, common industries include energy, consumer goods, and media and entertainment [3].) Make a list of any that sound interesting and conduct additional research to find out about major roles, career trajectories, and projected growth,



In addition to thinking through the areas mentioned above on your own, you can also turn to various career resources for more guided help.



College career center: If you’re still in college, take advantage of the career resources your college or university may offer. You may be able to meet with a counselor or advisor trained to help you transition from college to a career.



Career coach: You can find a career coach trained to help clients learn more about what kinds of work would best suit them. Career coaches are an additional expense, so make sure to research their credentials, experience, and background to make sure they will be a good fit for your needs.



You’ve likely gathered a lot of information by now. Once you have a bigger picture of yourself, start to conduct research on various career possibilities. You can use the list you made regarding your interests, values, and traits, combined with your top motivations, to begin looking for careers or industries that might be a good fit.



For example, do you really like drawing? Look at careers or industries requiring that talent to some extent. Are you interested in the issue of income inequality? Research organizations that work to improve that issue and browse their job openings site. Is one of your biggest strengths creative problem solving? Look for careers and industries that need your skill set.



Write down each option that sounds interesting, and pay attention to the results that will help you achieve your biggest priorities. For example, if flexibility is important to you then focus on remote roles rather than ones that require you to be in an office.



Once you’ve come up with some career ideas that sound interesting, follow the next steps to help you explore each option.



1. Use job search sites. LinkedIn, Indeed, and Monster are just a few sites dedicated to posting job openings. As you peruse roles available in your area, read more about the responsibilities for each one. Highlight the job titles that sound like a good fit.



Helpful questions:



Does the job meet my needs and many of my preferences?



Does this career align with my values?



Will I accomplish one of my short-term or long-term goals with it?



What does it feel like to think about these career options?



2. Cross-reference company reviews. Use Glassdoor or other sites to learn more about a particular company you’re considering, or conduct more general research on the industry in which they’re situated. Pay attention to any current issues being discussed in that industry.



3. Set up informational interviews. If you’ve found a role at a specific company that sounds interesting, look to see if you have any connections you can ask for an informational interview. If you want to find more general information about a role, look for any connections you have—or connections of connections—who are currently doing that work. Asking about a career before you pursue one can help you gather useful information.



Choosing a career is a process that unfolds over time. You can discover more with the Career Discovery specialization from the University System of Georgia. Over three classes, you’ll learn about exploring different career paths and planning your career. If you’d like to strengthen many transferable skills that can feed a successful career, try the specialization Career Success from UCI Division of Continuing Education, which covers project management, finance, and communication, among other subjects.

##7 common factors that influence students career choice- Manav Rachna



Career selection is an important stage in a student’s life. It influences a number of decisions that he/she takes based on their career choices. Choice of a subject, a university, an institution, a company, a job profile depends on the career one chooses to pursue.Nowadays it is quite certain to find students confused or unaware of their career path, even after having completed their graduation. They seem unsure of the degrees they hold as it doesn’t given them a clear vision of what they want to do.



Choosing Right Career is So Important For Students



Career Planning is no more a one-time occurrence that would end with the decision of the right university or college. It extends until we get the right job and get a satisfying work profile.After completion of schooling, one tends to select a stream based on their previous best performance. If a student scores 90 percentile in Science he/she wants to become an engineer/ doctor and likewise they go for commerce and every other subject. In more than 90% of the cases, it turns out to be haste or a wrong decision. The basis on which we evaluate our career choice remains unjustified.



Students who face exam anxiety and fail to perform up to their standard in the classroom tests are left out in the race. They are treated as a non-performer or a below-average student. Similarly, there are few who manage to excel just by rote learning. Some depend on their families to make the right call; well, some choose to follow the crowd. There is no clarity of one’s self-interest. This is the first wrong step that can lead them to the wrong path.



Make your Career choice Wisely



A wrong career choice can also increase the investment cost of a student in his/her education. Every time when a student’s career vision oscillates it calls for unnecessary expenditure. Most of the students invest huge amount of money as well as time in getting clarity over their career choice. They keep changing their subjects, even after having done majors in a particular subject they end up choosing a totally different profession.



Find the Best Career For You



What is most important is to have a good and clear career choice at an early stage so that it allows one to excel and achieve better in the chosen profession.



Brig. S. N. Setia, the Director of the ICT who has been associated with the Manav Rachna International University (MRIU) for long , has carved out 7 most common factors that influence the career choice of a student, which often swerves them from making the correct choice.

7 Most Common Factors that Influence the Career Choice Among Students



Parents’ Desire/Parental Pressure:



Choosing a career just to live up to the parents expectation is the most common decision taking by students at an early stage, which they tend to regret later. Most of the students from business families are by default expected to choose commerce and hence B.Com or BBA as their suited career course. Some who resist submit to the parental pressure leading to an unsuccessful career graph. Such influences under the garb of adhering to their guardians wish are considered unfruitful for the students in long run.



Peer Persuasion:



This is the easiest way of getting away from taking self decision. Most of the students want to follow the crowd to get to their destination. ‘Follow your friends’ is the most trending exercise visible during the selection of a university/college. Majority choice is considered the best choice. This mindset has increased the count in the mediocre group where students fail to succeed in their career and just keep on it with an average performance.



Past Performance:



This is in fact the most unjustified and distorted basis of analyzing one’s performance and interest area. In India, we are not only churned in an old education system of rote learning but we believe in the numbers to prove our caliber. This practice of determining one’s interest field based on one time exam performance has often led to a wrong career decision.



Potential:



Potential of a student can be legitimate criterion for choosing a career. Very few are able to identify their potential and choose their subject of knowledge based on it. A career selected on the basis of one’s potential has greater prospect of assuring success.



Placements:



We wish to choose a profession that can provide for our bread and butter. Placement opportunities in a particular university are thus considered most important factor for the students when they harp about their career choice. Good placement options are an important motivation driver for students in their Career Planning.



Personality Driven:



Most of the people choose their interest field on the basis of their personality and character. It can be the other way around also, when a career chooses them based on their personality. Here personality includes not only the outward presentation of a student but the perception he/she holds about society. A good communicator, who has good command on his/her language skills, is more inclined towards a mass communication stream. Similarly, a good leader who has the capacity to influence masses chooses a management field. Personality traits always help in deciding a good career, for it is easy to hone the skills we already acquire.



Affordability (Paisa):



This is the basic and the most essential criterion for most of them who set out to make their career. Affordability or Paisa in lay man’s language determines the purchasing power of  individuals who dares to dream. In India, when Right to Education aims to ensure education for all, it fails to distribute the standard quality of education. One, who can afford it, can only receive the ace quality training, knowledge and plum opportunities. Most of the students neglect their interest and choose a career that fits their pocket well.



Brig. Setia says” Career choice should not be based on any particular model or concept. One should choose his/her career on the basis of his interest in a particular area. The above mention model of 7 P’s can only be an influential factor in the career selection process, it should not be the criterion for Career Planning”.Career Planning is essential to ensure a successful and enriching work life.

#How to choose a career | Prospects.ac.uk



If you're stuck for job ideas and you're unsure  where your skills might best be served, it's worth coming up with a career development plan - simply follow these four steps to choosing a career



A career plan is a strategy you'll continuously develop to manage your learning and progression throughout your working life. Consisting of four stages, its purpose is to help you visualise the actions you need to take to achieve your career goals, and how to put these actions into practice.



The four stages of a career plan are:



identify your skills and interestsexplore career ideasmake a decisionset achievable goals.



Career planning is important for a number of reasons - having a career development plan in place reduces the risk of you making impulsive decisions, and it helps you to recognise when you're ready to look for new career opportunities and develop new skills.



This model can be used by anyone - from school leavers to students, graduates and career changers.



Learn more about what the process involves and how to map out your career journey.



1. Identify your skills and interests



Choosing a career is a big deal. You'll spend a significant amount of your life at work and so in order to enjoy your job, remain motivated and fulfil your potential, you need to choose wisely.



You first need to know yourself. This means taking stock of your skills and assessing your interests and values.



It's important to understand your range of skills and knowledge, so you can see if they're a good fit for the job you'd like to do. Being aware of the skills you have also helps to highlight any gaps that may need to be filled to achieve your career goals.



Make a list of all your transferable and specialist skills, with examples of when you've demonstrated each. An honest assessment of your skills, values and interests will prove useful when narrowing down your options in the next step. You can also see where you measure up in terms of the skills employers are looking for.



Consider where you are now, where you want to be and how you're going to get there. If choosing a career has left you feeling lost, start by asking yourself the following questions:



What am I good at?What are my interests, motivations and values?What did I most enjoy at university?What kind of lifestyle do I want?What do I want from my career?What is important to me?



If you're struggling to identify your strengths, weaknesses and character traits, taking practice psychometric tests could bring them to light.



By the end of this step, you'll have identified the sort of jobs that will suit you, but won't yet have enough information to make a decision on which to pursue.

2. Explore career ideas



This is all about researching the job market and career pathways that interest you and narrowing down your options.



Consider what your ideal job sector would be, and discover its key trends by researching the local, national and global jobs market. This will help you to discover more potential career paths, and understand which roles are expanding or declining.



There are three overarching job sectors. These are:



Private - sole traders, partnerships and limited companiesPublic - local and national governments, plus their agencies and chartered bodiesNot-for-profit - often referred to as the third sector, or the charity and voluntary work sector.



Browsing job profiles may introduce you to some less obvious career paths where your skills and qualifications could be useful.



Compile a shortlist of around five to ten jobs, before considering the advantages and disadvantages of each in terms of:



career developmentemployment outlookentry requirementsjob descriptionrelated jobssalary and conditionstraining.



You must also consider which size of employer best fits with your personality and work ethic. Are you more suited to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), large companies or self-employment?



This is the perfect time to consider work experience and internships, work shadowing and volunteering opportunities. They'll help you to gain an insight into the areas you're interested in before committing yourself to a certain career path.



3. Make a decision



Now you're ready to start making decisions. Combine what you've learned about yourself with what you've discovered about your options and the graduate jobs market.



From your job ideas list, decide which role interests you the most and select one or two alternatives to fall back on if you're not able to pursue your first choice.



To help make a decision, ask yourself the following questions:



Will I enjoy doing the job every day?Does it meet most of my preferences?Do I have the right skills?Does the company fit with my values?Are there any location/financial/skills limitations I need to take into account?Is the job realistic in terms of salary?

If you're struggling to reach a conclusion, there are a number of exercises you can try to aid the decision-making process. Listing the pros and cons of a particular job or career is often useful, as is completing a personal SWOT analysis:



Strengths - What skills, traits, certifications and connections would you bring to the role that nobody else could? What makes you unique?Weaknesses - What areas could you improve on? Do you lack any skills holding you back from excelling in the role you'd like to pursue?Opportunities - Is your industry growing? Could you take advantage of your competitors' mistakes or gaps in the market?Threats - Could your weaknesses slow your progression at work? Is there anything else that may stand in the way of your development, such as changes in technology?



There's plenty of support available to help you decide. Look to:



company websitesfamily and friendsnewspaper articlesprofessional bodies and industry conferencestutorsuniversity careers and employability services.



Keep in mind that you'll probably be suited to more than one career and today's jobseekers usually change career direction more than once in their working life. The key to being employable is having the ability to adapt and learn new skills.



Learn more about making a career change.



4. Set achievable goals



Your career plan should outline how you'll get to where you want to be, what actions are needed and when, and separated into your short, medium and long-term goals. Constantly review your progress, especially after each short-term goal is reached.



You must also establish a backup career development plan, in case your situation changes. Map several alternative paths to your long-term goal, considering how you'll overcome the types of problems you might encounter - such as training requirements - at each step.



Your first short-term goal may involve improving your CV and cover letter. Other short or medium-term targets could include undertaking relevant internships, gaining volunteering experience or attending careers fairs.



Make an appointment with your university's careers service to ask an adviser to check over your career action plan and discuss your career choices and goals for the future, if you feel you need some professional reassurance. Discover where to find help at university.



Finally, don't forget that career planning is a continuous process. Revisit and review your aims and objectives throughout your career, and don't feel constrained by the goals you've set - the structure of a career plan should help you clearly map out the route to trying something new.

#How to decide on a career? 10 essential questions to find your perfect job



Your career has a big impact on your future. It will shape your identity, personal fulfilment, lifestyle, income, family and retirement. Don’t let the opinions or expectations of others sway your decision making. Ultimately, deciding on a career is solely down to you. In this article we explain how to decide on a future job, what questions to ask yourself when choosing a career and what factors to consider when weighing up the options so that you make the best informed decision for your future.



Choosing a career in 4 easy steps



Interests, Values & Personality Traits



1. What are my interests?



The activities you enjoy doing in your free time can give you insights into careers that would be satisfying and fulfilling for you. To figure out your interests, ask yourself:





What hobbies do I enjoy?

Do I prefer spending time indoors or outdoors?

Do I enjoy working with people, animals, data or, books?

What activities would I miss the most if I could no longer do them?









2. What are my values?



Everyone has values or things that are important to them, such as financial security, social justice or work-life balance. These values can help you decide what type of career to pursue. Here for instance, consider a job that pays well if you value financial security, and consider the type of hours you'd like to work to achieve work-life balance and what career may offer that to you.







3. What is my personality?



Your personality is the way you think, feel and behave. It can be an important factor in guiding you toward a specific career, so consider several aspects of your personality as you reflect on your future.





Are you a leader or a follower?

Do you prefer to work alone or in a group?

Do you prefer to cooperate or compete with others?

Do you enjoy helping others or prefer to empower them to do things themselves?

Are you a thinker who focuses on ideas or are you a doer who takes action?

Are you a creative and artistic person or do you thrive with structure and routine?





Skills, Attributes & Education



4. What are my skills?



Right now, you already possess skills that can help you succeed in the future. Think about your hard skills and soft skills.





Hard skills - skills you’ve acquired through study, such as culinary arts or computer programming.

Soft skills - the people and life skills you possess, including empathy, teamwork, problem-solving and time management.





Remember, skills can be developed and new skills can be learned at any stage of life, so don't let a lack of skills put you off a certain career path. Let the existing skills you have guide you. Whether you require further skill development or not will be the next challenge.







5. What are my talents and strengths?



From the time you were little, you demonstrated talents and strengths that make you unique; these qualities can help you succeed in your chosen career. In fact, Sir Ken Robinson, author of The Element, Out of Our Minds, says that:



You owe it to yourself to ensure that there’s some part of your day or week when you’re doing what comes most naturally to you and makes you feel at your most centered and authentic.



If you don't know your talents and strengths, make a list of everything you’re good at doing. Your family members, friends, teachers, boss and mentors can help you write this list that you will use to narrow down potential careers.







6. What education or training do I need?



Certain careers require advanced education and financial investment. For example, you may need eight to 12 years of education and training to be a doctor, but you could earn a hospitality management bachelor in four years. Think about the time and money required to pursue a career as you make your decision.



If you already have these hard skills but feel as though you a missing a piece of the puzzle, soft skills such as effective communication,  are highly sought after in leadership positions in the hospitality industry. Skills such as communication, leadership, critical thinking, organization, follow through, cultural competency, flexibility, and customer service, just to name a few.



According to Daniel Ciapponi, a Senior Lecturer at EHL, these soft skills are currently missing in hospitality in what he describes a Skills Gap. Therefore, developing and honing these skills will give any candidate the competitive edge.



As a general rule, although there are exceptions, the higher the salary bracket, the higher the education level is required. However, any career path is worthy of such time and financial investment, but you have to decide whether it is worth it to you.



Salary & Lifestyle



7. How much money do I want to make?



Different careers provide different monetary rewards. Even though salary shouldn’t be the main factor in choosing a career, your paycheck can play a role in your quality of life and where you live. Consider your earning potential as you narrow down your career options.







8. Where do I want to live?



Some jobs are more readily accessible while others can only be performed in certain locations. For example, you will probably need to live in a rural location if you choose to work as a park ranger or farmer, and you may want to live near an urban area if you plan to pursue a finance or fashion career. Plan carefully to ensure you can work where you want to live - and vice versa.







Availability & Competition



9. Are there jobs available in this career?



LinkedIn publishes stats on the most in-demand jobs globally, a variety of IT roles have been the highest in-demand for a number of years now, followed by sales people and registered nurses.



Interestingly, statistics from the second half of 2021 showed that the biggest amount of new job listings during this time came from the hospitality sector, with housekeepers, food specialists and kitchen staff all making the top 10 spots. The labor shortage in the hospitality industry happened because of the dramatic reduction in staff when global restrictions were imposed and subsequent surge in demand for the industry caused by Covid-19 restrictions loosening again. Whilst the industry is desperately trying to attract new talent to the industry it presents a perfect opportunity for young graduates to bag themselves better working conditions such as work-life balance, paid leave and higher salaries.



While you don’t have to work in one of these popular occupations, you should consider the potential job availability in your future career field.  The travel and tourism sector is estimated to contribute $8.6 trillion to the global economy in 2022, supported by 330 million jobs in 2022.



10. How competitive is this career path?



Choosing a competitive career path isn't to be automatically shunned. Competitive by its very nature means there must be a rich reward for those who are successful in attaining the post and therefore it is a worthwhile pursuit. You must, however, weigh up the risk vs. reward. Are you prepared to accept rejection and failure countless times before you're accepted? Are you prepared to jump through as many hoops as required to reach this goal, such as further education, gaining internships and real-world work experience, and often extensive application and interview processes? If the answer is yes, then you probably have what it takes!







Over to you to choose your career



After answering these 10 questions, we hope that the clarity of your vision and talents has been sharpened. Remember that audacity and ambition have a better chance to develop once you are fully aware of how you function, what your strengths are, and what you value. The future is yours!"

","#Pro and Con: Bottled Water Ban | Britannica



To access extended pro and con arguments, sources, and discussion questions about whether bottled water should be banned, go to ProCon.org.



Americans consumed 14.4 billion gallons of bottled water in 2019, up 3.6% from 2018, in what has been a steadily increasing trend since 2010. In 2016, bottled water outsold soda for the first time and has continued to do so every year since, making it the number one packaged beverage in the United States. 2020 revenue for bottled water was $61.326 million by June 15, and the overall market is expected to grow to $505.19 billion by 2028.



Globally, about 20,000 plastic bottles were bought every second in 2017, the majority of which contained drinking water. More than half of those bottles were not turned in for recycling, and of those recycled, only 7% were turned into new bottles.



In 2013, Concord, MA, became the first US city to ban single-serve plastic water bottles, citing environmental and waste concerns. Since then, many cities, colleges, entertainment venues, and national parks have followed suit, including San Francisco, the University of Vermont, the Detroit Zoo, and the Grand Canyon National Park.



Pro



Banning bottled water would reduce waste and protect the environment. Banning bottled water is good for your health. Banning bottled water would save money, and public water fountains are convenient and plentiful.



Con



Banning bottled water removes a healthy choice and leads to increased consumption of unhealthy sugary drinks. Other types of beverages have plastic containers that are more harmful than plastic water bottles, and bans don't necessarily reduce waste. Bottled water is a practical emergency water supply.



This article was published on June 3, 2021, at Britannica’s ProCon.org, a nonpartisan issue-information source.

#Should Bottled Water Be Banned: Pros and Cons | My Own Water



Should Bottled Water Be Banned?



The Pros



#1 Banning Plastic Bottles is a Step Closer to a Healthy Environment



It is common knowledge that plastic bottles contribute to our carbon footprints. Plastic water bottles leach harmful chemicals into the water and the environment, making them a menace for both the ecosystem and our own health.



‍



#2 Banning Bottled Water would Protect Natural Water Sources



Up to 64% of bottled water is sourced from municipal water, also known as tap water, which can drain the supply meant for public use. Additionally, some bottled water companies are not transparent with their water sources, and destroy natural resources to supply their water bottles. A ban on bottled water would protect these supplies.



‍



#3 Banning Bottled Water Opens Opportunities to Innovate Alternative Materials



The ban on bottled water is mostly limited to banning plastic water bottles. Other sustainable and eco-friendly materials are welcome for use as alternatives to plastic. In select cities across the US, private establishments have already enacted plastic water bottle bans, which opened opportunities for materials like stainless steel and aluminum to be commonplace.



‍



The Cons



#1 Banning Removes a Healthy Drink Option



Since 2016, bottled water outsold soda as the preferred drink of choice for the majority of consumers. The sales of water continue to skyrocket since then, taking a lead over unhealthy, sugary drinks. Removing bottles of water as a choice would veer people towards soda bottles instead, which would not solve the problem, and increase rates of diabetes and obesity.



#2 Banning Bottled Water is Not the Only Way



Some experts believe that banning bottled water is just a band aid solution to the ever-growing plastic problem. Certainly enough, plastic containers aren't limited to your ordinary water bottle. Plastic comes in various forms from food to single-use containers, and banning one or the other would not solve the problem. There are other ways to remedy plastic pollution.



#3 Other Drinks will Still Continue to Contribute to Global Warming



Out of the 20,000 plastic bottles sold every second, more than 10,000 of them contained drinking water. However, even if you remove drinking water out of that statistic, you would be left with bottles of sports drinks, sodas, juices, and other beverages consumers can opt for over water. This contributes to plastic waste concerns just the same.



‍



Alternatives to Bottled Water



‍



‍



Refillable Water Bottles



One of the best alternatives to plastic containers is to use reusable ones. Most reusable bottle materials are made from stainless steel or plastic, but silicone and glass bottles also exist. These are meant to be multi-use, where you use the bottle infinitely until it can no longer safely contain your beverage.



‍



However, most people tend to use more than one reusable bottle at a time depending on their aesthetic or affinity for certain tumbler designs. It is also inconvenient to bring your bottle around, and refilling it with water from unknown sources is not safe.



‍



Glass Bottles



Glass bottles don't leach chemicals into your water, and they are endlessly recyclable as well. The problem is that glass shatters easily, and can be dangerous for small children to drink from. Glass bottles make for good alternatives to plastic ones, but must be handled with proper care.



‍



Aluminum Bottles



For a bottle that ticks all the boxes: portable, safe, recyclable, sustainable, and sanitary, aluminum bottles are the way to go. Aluminum is endlessly recyclable, but unlike glass, will not shatter upon impact. Aluminum is also lightweight and portable, which can top plastic materials in safety and sustainability. They are also reusable.



‍



My Own Water produces our own line of aluminum bottles. We understand the plastic problem, and we aim to provide our customers with a guilt-free and sustainable choice. Our aluminum bottles are recycled, which uses up only 5% of the energy to process raw aluminum. Make the better choice, and go for aluminum bottled water!



‍



Management Over Restrictions



From a privileged perspective, it seems easy to ban bottled water due to their negative environmental impacts. However, this decision is not fair to those areas where bottled water is the only potable water source, and the most practical emergency water supply.



‍



Thick back to those times when a bottle of water was your only safe and practical option to drink: like in roadside carnivals or restaurants where the safety of their tap water and other drinks is dubious. In some landlocked areas, bottled water may be the only drink option for the people living there.



‍



Bottled water is not all bad, but the more damaging aspect is how we manage our plastic waste. In the US, only 30%, or less, of plastic water bottles are recycled yearly, leaving 70% or so plastic water bottles littering the environment. The problem lies with the way we process this waste, which has room for improvement.



‍



What we can personally do is make the choice for better alternatives like using a reusable bottle, or aluminum bottles instead of plastic. This way, we maintain the convenience of plastic without harming the environment.#Bottled Water Should Not be Banned Essay - Free Essay Example - Edubirdie



Evo Morales once said: “Sooner or later, we will have to recognize that the Earth has rights too, to live without pollution. What mankind must know is that human beings cannot live without Mother Earth, but the planet can live without humans.” Pollution is defined as the presence in our introduction into the environment of a substance that has harmful or poisonous effects. Single use plastic is definitely a massive problem in regards to pollution of marine life, but I do not believe that banning bottled water would be a constructive method of saving our beautiful planet. There is a common catchphrase among people who don’t see pollution as a problem that says “the solution to pollution is dilution.” A National Geographic article written in 2010 states “we need to look no further than the New-Jersey dead zone or the thousand-mile-wide swath of decomposing plastic to see that this “dilution” policy has helped place a once flourishing ocean ecosystem on the brink of collapse.” (National Geographic, 2010) There are many benefits to bottled water. Humans require a certain amount of water every day in order to remain healthy and there are unfortunately a number of obstacles that prevent us from acquiring a sufficient amount of water. It is said that simply carrying a bottle of water around as one does one’s day-to-day activities can promote increased water consumption, resulting in an improved lifestyle of humans. Bottled water also has the option of flavouring and added nutrients, which is a disruption of the monotonous flavor of standard water. This, as well as the addition of much needed nutrients and electrolytes that our bodies are in desperate need of, is also able to promise healthy drinking habits. Although tap water is prepared to be drinkable by careful hands, one runs the risk of one’s tap adding contaminants and impurities to the filtered water, contaminants that bottled water is undoubtedly missing. (The Water Depot, Inc) Banning bottled water would also remove a healthy beverage option for the communities of South Africa, which would lead to the increase in the consumption of unhealthy carbonated soft drinks and would “remove a practical option for water storage and dissemination during times when municipal tap water supplies are contaminated” (ProCon.org, 2018). This article on the pros and cons of banning bottled water also states that a ban on bottled water is misguided as a pollution control method for the reason that other beverages are sold in containers that are equally, if not more harmful than plastic bottles. Although I do not believe that bottled water should be banned, there are some undeniable pros to the boycott of water being sold in plastic bottles. About 70% of plastic bottles sold in America are not recycled; therefore banning bottled water would reduce waste and protect the environment. Banning bottled water would reduce financial costs since bottled water can cost between 400 and 2000 times more than tap water. Bottling water can also drain water sources since almost 64% of bottled water is taken from municipal supplies.

B. F. Skinner once said that the environment would continue to deteriorate until pollution practices are abandoned, which is why I believe that the problem at hand is not the plastic itself, but the way the human race is disposing of the plastic. There are many different methods of plastic waste disposal such as landfilling, incineration, recycling and biodegradation. Landfilling is considered “highly wasteful as it requires a vast amount of space and the chemical constituents and energy contained in plastic is lost in this disposal route”. Incineration has a tendency to cause negative effects on the environment and the health of living beings because of the hazardous substances that are released into the atmosphere as a result. Therefore, the most effective methods of plastic waste disposal are Recycling and Biodegradation. (Blog.nus, 2016) If the people of the human race could stop blaming plastic and start looking for the root of the problem, then perhaps the level of pollution of the earth would not be as high as it is today. Every minute, the equivalent to one garbage truck’s worth of plastic is dumped into our oceans (Earth Day Network, 2018). Approximately eight million metric tons of plastic are propelled into the ocean every year. The reason for this is not the materials we are using, it is the method of which we are disposing these materials Plastic recycling is “the process of recovering scrap or waste plastic and reprocessing the material into useful products.” When different types of plastic are melted together, they have a tendency to separate their phases (eg. water and oil) and solidify in these layers. These boundaries can cause weaknesses in the structure of the resulting material, which makes the plastic harder to recycle. There is a massive controversy associated with the use of plastic where people are under the impression that plastic is killing the environment because it is not biodegradable, however, the percentage of plastic that can be 100% recycled increases when manufacturers of packaged goods minimize the mixing of materials in their packaging. (Wikipedia) Recycling has a number of benefits such as creating jobs in the recycling and manufacturing industry; saving energy, reducing greenhouse gas emission; and saving natural resources such as timber, water, and minerals. In the process of recycling, the first step is to find materials that can be recycled, which will not be a problem considering the previously mentioned amount of plastic currently in our oceans. Once the materials are found, the next step is to find a secondary use of the material. Since bottled water has a number of good and productive purposes, we can use the plastic and recycle it into bottles for water. Once the bottle has been used and thrown away, it can be sufficiently cleaned and then used as another water bottle. The third step of the recycling process is to purchase goods manufactured from recycled materials which can be seen on the label of the product (Residential Waste Systems, 2013) Oceanographer Marcus Eriksen released a paper entitled “Plastic Pollution in the World’s Ocean” for which he and his team of researchers journeyed across all five of the ocean’s major gyres in order to collect samples. They came to the conclusion that there are over five trillion pieces of plastic polluting our oceans. This causes seals, turtles, and seabirds to constantly become trapped in rings of plastic. Creatures such as the albatross are also found frequently feeding on the plastic material that it mistakes for food. (Habbib, 2016) In conclusion, based on the above information and evidence, I believe that bottled water should not be banned because there are much more important activities we could be performing in order to save our beautiful planet.

They came to the conclusion that there are over five trillion pieces of plastic polluting our oceans. This causes seals, turtles, and seabirds to constantly become trapped in rings of plastic. Creatures such as the albatross are also found frequently feeding on the plastic material that it mistakes for food. (Habbib, 2016) In conclusion, based on the above information and evidence, I believe that bottled water should not be banned because there are much more important activities we could be performing in order to save our beautiful planet.



Despite all the good reasons as to why bottled water should be banned, if the human race simply disposed of their plastic in the proper manner, then the ban of water in plastic packaging would not be necessary to save the environment. B. F. Skinner once said that the environment would continue to deteriorate until pollution practices are abandoned, which is why I believe that the problem at hand is not the plastic itself, but the way the human race is disposing of the plastic. There are many different methods of plastic waste disposal such as landfilling, incineration, recycling and biodegradation. Landfilling is considered “highly wasteful as it requires a vast amount of space and the chemical constituents and energy contained in plastic is lost in this disposal route”. Incineration has a tendency to cause negative effects on the environment and the health of living beings because of the hazardous substances that are released into the atmosphere as a result. Therefore, the most effective methods of plastic waste disposal are Recycling and Biodegradation. (Blog.nus, 2016) If the people of the human race could stop blaming plastic and start looking for the root of the problem, then perhaps the level of pollution of the earth would not be as high as it is today. Every minute, the equivalent to one garbage truck’s worth of plastic is dumped into our oceans (Earth Day Network, 2018). Approximately eight million metric tons of plastic are propelled into the ocean every year. The reason for this is not the materials we are using, it is the method of which we are disposing these materials Plastic recycling is “the process of recovering scrap or waste plastic and reprocessing the material into useful products.” When different types of plastic are melted together, they have a tendency to separate their phases (eg. water and oil) and solidify in these layers. These boundaries can cause weaknesses in the structure of the resulting material, which makes the plastic harder to recycle. There is a massive controversy associated with the use of plastic where people are under the impression that plastic is killing the environment because it is not biodegradable, however, the percentage of plastic that can be 100% recycled increases when manufacturers of packaged goods minimize the mixing of materials in their packaging. (Wikipedia) Recycling has a number of benefits such as creating jobs in the recycling and manufacturing industry; saving energy, reducing greenhouse gas emission; and saving natural resources such as timber, water, and minerals. In the process of recycling, the first step is to find materials that can be recycled, which will not be a problem considering the previously mentioned amount of plastic currently in our oceans. Once the materials are found, the next step is to find a secondary use of the material. Since bottled water has a number of good and productive purposes, we can use the plastic and recycle it into bottles for water. Once the bottle has been used and thrown away, it can be sufficiently cleaned and then used as another water bottle.
