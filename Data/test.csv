Self-concept is the core of Super's theory. Many factors contribute to the self-concept such as biological characteristics, social roles, and the interplay of others reactions on the individual. Development of the self concept begins in late to early adolescence. It is subjective and can be influenced by perceptions from family, peers, and teachers about themselves or about occupations.Super’s Model begins with identification of the child’s curiosities. Curiosities may evolve from exposure to new objects, new people, or various other stimuli. These curiosities lead to the child exploring and obtaining information that helps develop their interests. Super explained that it is important discourage disruptive behavior while still allowing children to be curious and explore. Encouraging positive curiosity and exploration can help children meet their curiosity needs and may help caregivers have an alternative to punishment. Because exploration leads to more exploration the child is then able to obtain more information about the environment and consequently may lead to a higher potential of vocational planning.According to Super’s Model one way in which children process information is through imitation. This imitation may be of a key figure in the child’s life, such as a role model. In the development of the child’s self-concept the child can incorporate or reject characteristics of their key figure in order to better suit themselves.

99879976,0,"#Career Ladder Is Fading -    This talk meant that there is no limit to how far an individual can go in their profession. Corporate hierarchy is disappearing, and the evolving nature of employment is becoming harder to ignore. Despite all the arguments, there is an agreement that substantial and continuous changes are taking place in the structure of employment. Throughout their working lives, the typical worker will hold down twelve different positions. Millennials are sometimes referred to as the “job-hopping cohort” because of this phenomenon. To be successful in squiggly careers, one must be aware of their values, ambitions, and motivations.Due to technological breakthroughs and economic trends, work is becoming increasingly virtual, dispersed, and collaborative. It is now more necessary than ever to have a diverse workplace in terms of demographics, age, environment, expertise, and experience to perform well at work. It is possible to have a squiggly career that is not even characterized by moving up the ladder, but rather a profession that may follow many diverse courses. The ladder has been replaced with a workplace lattice that allows for the free flow of ideas, growth, and admiration. Working in a dynamic and customized manner is made easier with a lattice structure that encourages professional growth and active participation.By giving additional options for employees to balance their personal and work life, lattice arrangements may boost productivity while reducing real estate costs and attrition. Cisco, for example, cultivates adaptive leaders by rotating its most promising directors throughout the company’s many departments and divisions. The idea of a one-size-fits-all corporate training scheme is becoming obsolete. Because of the lattice’s lack of hierarchies, everyone may engage and be encouraged to do so."

My Career, My Career Interest, and the Value of a College EducationMy Career, My Career Interest, and the Value of a College EducationAbstractMy career path has been chosen for me through heredity, as my length of time on Earth has been pre-determined by the Great Creator. How I choose to use this time will be referred to as my success statement of life. How I am remembered will depend on what I accomplish. In short, life is given, but not guaranteed. We all have the choices before us, which determine if life is easy or difficult. Many times, I had the option of all or nothing, and for some reason chose all every time. In this paper, I will explore my present career as a manufacturing engineer, a career interest as a plant manager, and the value of a college education to organizations, customers, and myself.A small bit of historical information is in order to set the tone for this presentation. I was raised, as most young boys are, learning to read, write, and the other necessary evils of elementary education. My father was finally discharged from the U.S. Army Air Corp. and World War II, where he had been a Lt. Col., and taught the use of the Norden Bombsight to bombardiers and crews of the time. My early years were basically fun years, as I learned how to fish, shoot, hunt, about dogs, cats, and toys…many, many, toys. My mother believed in spoiling me, since I was the only child, and for eight years, I was the only object of me parents’ attention. In 1958, however, that situation changed forever, with the birth of my little brother, and three years later, my little sister arrived. These two events, little did I realize, would have a profound effect on my life. They would alter the way I felt about life, contribute to changes in my personality, and most of all, formed the basis for my later life in general, including my chosen profession.My father, prior to WWII, worked for Victor adding Machine Company, who designed the Norden Bombsight. After the war, he and another man started an oil well drilling company. He did all the engineering required except for the Geology, and co-owned the company until the late 1950’s. My father was not a degreed petroleum engineer, but was in fact qualified. He had studied under his father, who also had owned an oil company in Southern Illinois for most of his life.

d1f19986,0,"#Career Path Development Case Study: Human ResourcesCase study of a career, analysed in terms of career theories covered in the module.Introduction:Tina1’s career path is outlined below and a number of theories will be used throughout this essay to examine it.Career Outline:Tina’s profession was not a career goal, which had been agreed on from an early age. Tina chose to go to university due to external influences from her family. She embarked on a business studies degree in 2006 and upon graduating, decided that HR was the field she wanted to pursue. The decision was based on factors such as an unstable economy and career choice being safe. Whilst undertaking the undergraduate degree, Tina worked Part time at PC World. Due to Tina having a generic degree in nature and having graduated when the recession had hit, her career was built by her carrying out temporary HR assignments in various industries and sectors. It was extremely difficult for Tina to be given continuous temporary roles so when she wasn’t working in HR she worked in her other role at PC World. Tina was eventually offered a permanent role as an HR Assistant for a private sector organisation in London and decided at this stage to resign from her role at PC World.Get Help With Your EssayIf you need assistance with writing your essay, our professional essay writing service is here to help!Essay Writing ServiceHaving decided that HR was the career path that she wished to follow, Tina decided to undertake a postgraduate degree in it. Tina had resigned from her permanent role when deciding to embark on the university course so upon graduating had to carry out a number of temporary HR assignments to enable her to gain experience at different levels. The qualification gave Tina an advantage, as she possessed the qualification required for her to progress in HR. Tina after having completed her postgraduate degree has seen herself working in organisations such as the National Gallery, BEIS and the NHS, a position she currently holds today.Career development and the link to ages and stages:A career is open to several interpretations and is described as being a mixture of roles performed by a person in a course of their life (Super, 1957), as a decision tree depicting the decision points faced by a person going through school and the world of work (Flanagan & Cooley, 1966) and as a sequence of life phases in which conflicting groups of developmental responsibilities are encountered with (Buehler 1933; Super, 1957). A life career rainbow has been suggested (Super, 1980) in an effort to outline more appropriately the many different aspects of a career throughout a person’s life.A life career rainbow has been offered as a means of helping to hypothesis careers, the progressive involvement and emotional commitment to each role. Self-actualisation in a number of different roles, role clashes, and the factors of role selection and performance are also discussed.Two strong changes are identified in Tina’s education and career; the move from a generic business studies degree and the decision to embark on a career in HR resulting in a move to go back to university to complete a postgraduate degree in it. Both will be outlined and assessed alongside (Super, 1980) life career rainbow model. The career decision as described by Tina was due to her graduating at a time when the economy was unstable and feeling that a career in HR would be a safe choice. It’s important to highlight that Tina whilst exploring roles in HR also worked part-time in PC world and had thought to carve a career for herself in retail prior to graduating. This however later was concluded to be an unviable option.Two stages of the (Super, 1980) life career rainbow model will be concentrated on, as they are most relevant in outlining how the model is relevant to Tina’s education and career choice.According to the (Super, 1980) career rainbow model, at the ages of 15 – 24, we are exploring, thus meaning that we are still at the age at which we are unsure of what we’d like to do in terms of career. By exploring we are able to try out various types of roles, which we believe interest us at that particular point. Taking into account Tina’s educational background and career, it can be said that she explored working in retail whilst undertaking her undergraduate degree to get a sense of whether a career in retail upon graduating from university would be a viable option for her. Her undergraduate degree could also be construed, as her exploring as the degree that she selected for herself was generic which would eventually have resulted in her having to pick a career within a business remit for herself. Tina went to the university due to influences from her family and there could be a possibility that had she not been under those pressures, she would ultimately have chosen not to have gone to university.(Super, 1980) career rainbow model focuses on maintenance as being key for individuals from the ages of 45 – 64. Maintenance at this age would mean that an individual would’ve decided on their career and would be working in a role, which is suited to their skill set. Maintenance, however, does not tie in with career progression, as an individual could be happy to stay with an employer for a number of years and be receiving fulfilment from that job. This stage ties in nicely with Tina’s career as she was successful in being appointed in her first permanent HR role in 2012, embarked on completing an HR postgraduate degree in that same year and was able to gradually progress in her career by building up experience in various organisations. Tina was eager to learn and had supportive managers throughout her career and for those reasons outlined able to grow.(Super’s Life Career Rainbow 1980, 1997, 2002)The life career rainbow when first proposed had two major defects to it: lack of clear recognition particularly in relation to the factors of decisions, and that it seemed quite rigid in uniformity. (Super, 1980)The life rainbow model has a limitation, which can be construed as concerning in this day and age. There is agreement that growth may occur between the ages of 1- 4 and exploration may occur between the ages of 15 – 24, however, the other stages are out of sync. Establishment looks at individuals building a life and family between the ages of 25 – 44 however that may no longer be the case as we are living in a modern era and people are now deciding to have families later in life. Maintenance from the age of 45 – 64 also does not work as the younger generation are now more inclined to build their careers from a younger age. It is also important to highlight that maintenance does not necessarily link in with career progression. The final stage in the model outlines that decline begins at the age of 65+; however, this is no longer the case as many individuals are deciding to work longer. As per UK employment law, older workers can freely retire at a time that they choose. Employers cannot force their employees to retire or fix a retirement age. Recruitment of older workers might occur because of positive employer experience of staff continuing past 65 (Lain, 2012).Motivational theory(Maslow, 1943, 1954) hierarchy of needs is a motivational theory in HR and psychology that comprises of five stages of human needs.(Maslow’s hierarchy of needs 1943,1954)(Maslow, 1943) initially specified that individuals would be required to satisfy lower levels before proceeding to meet the higher-level growth needs. He later however specified that satisfaction of needs is not compulsory and admitted that his earlier accounts may have given a false impression that a need must be satisfied completely before the next need emergesTina’s parents would have provided her when younger with the physiological need. The physiological need is the biological requirement for human survival. When Tina, however, left university to pave a career for herself in HR, she would have provided herself with the physiological need. The basic functions such as sleep; food, drink, and shelter are needed in order for an individual to survive. Tina would‘ve been at an age where she would’ve been able to look after herself.Find Out How UKEssays.com Can Help You!Our academic experts are ready and waiting to assist with any writing project you may have. From simple essay plans, through to full dissertations, you can guarantee we have a service perfectly matched to your needs.View our servicesFurther up the hierarchy, we have esteem needs and self-actualisation needs. Tina would’ve been required to exhaust the esteem need in her career as that need focuses on building a reputation for herself and respect for others. It is important in an organisational context that individuals are able to build relationships with peers at all levels of the business. There would, therefore, have been a need for Tina to build relationships with both internal and external stakeholders of the business. Respect generally takes time and as you need to get to know people you work with that respect grows.The Self-actualisation stage focuses on Tina’s Career in HR and her going back to university to complete her postgraduate degree in HR. By completing the degree, she provided herself with ample experience and knowledge to allow her to better herself and grow.A limitation of this model is that the theory assumes that all needs need to be experienced together. Physiological needs are important due to them being based on human survival however the other needs are just as important. Tina would not have achieved the esteem need and self-actualisation need had she not bettered herself by going to university and paving a career for herself in the HR field. The physiological need is therefore not the all or none. The needs hold equal weighting when it comes to importance.Kaleidoscope theory(Maniero and Sullivan, 2005) developed a model to outline how men and women think about and enact their careers.‘A kaleidoscope career is created on an individual’s own terms defined not by an organisation but by an individual’s own life choices, values, and limitations. Like a kaleidoscope, a career is vibrant and as life changes, the career can be altered around those changes rather than surrendering control and letting an organisation dictate your life for you’. (Maniero and Sullivan, 2005)Tina’s decision to embark on a career in HR was due to factors such as; unstable economy and career choice being safe. Authenticity was not present in the early stages of her career, as she happened to fall into the HR field due to reasons mentioned above. Authenticity, however, did make itself available when Tina went back to university to complete her postgraduate degree in HR. It was at this point that she had recognised that HR was the field she wanted to build her career on.It is important to outline that mid-career there is a discrepancy between the model and Tina’s career. According to (Maniero and Sullivan, 2005), ‘ as people grow older, a shift in their priorities is made apparent. For women – the desire for challenge remains, however, is pushed back to make way for a new parameter – the need for balance.’ Tina’s desire for challenge remains and authenticity is present too as she feels passionate about the field she works in and longs to progress in it. Balance, however, is not apparent as Tina does not have priorities and commitments such as children and is able to work longer hours. Tina’s mid-career was initially motivated by money, however, as she progressed up the career ladder, the challenge aspect of the (Maniero and Sullivan, 2005) model increased for her as she was more motivated at that stage to better herself so she could apply for more senior level posts.‘When both men and women reach their thirties and forties, situations change for both. Men continue to pursue work challenges whilst women tend to back off to make room for the more personal aspects of their lives. There is a shift in the kaleidoscope for women whereas the pattern remains un-deviated for men who are in a breadwinner role’ (Maniero and Sullivan, 2005). Tina has seen some changes in her career since entering her thirties, however, backing off to make room for personal aspects of her life has not been one of them. Tina is more passionate about her role now than she was when she initially embarked on an HR career. Her thirst for challenge has increased, as has her thirst for authenticity. There is currently no room for balance in Tina’s career as it is not required.The kaleidoscope theory feels better suited to someone in the eighties who was happy to develop a career earlier on in their life but also get married and have children. Tina got married at 29, however, is now in her thirties and has no intentions of having children anytime soon. Tina is focused on challenge and authenticity is now more important to her than previously.ConclusionThe three theories used in this essay have played a nice role in outlining Tina’s educational and career choices. The (Super, 1980) model and the (Maniero and Sullivan, 2005) kaleidoscope model integrate quite nicely with each other in outlining how Tina’s education and career were formed. Not all stages of the (Maslow, 1943) hierarchy of needs model need to be met in order for it to work. Tina’s career choice was initially driven due to external influences however over time this changed."

According to the article, 36% of the students in high school don’t have an idea for their future or weren't taught to think about it in elementary.

There are many transferable skills and personalities that soar high above others but school should teach how the different personalities contribute to the different jobs. According to (Harrison 2014) 48% of employees are ready to switch jobs due to their current job not needing their personality or transferable skills. When thought that different personalities fit into different jobs or positions students will be encouraged to learn a variety of different transferable skills and also learn to work in various place with its suitable personalities. According to  Leadership IQ’s Global Talent Management Survey (Greensburg 2014) 81% of new hires fail to adapt to the jobs requirement in personality and transferable skills.

All in all good transferable skills and adaptable personalities can lead to a successful employees and can allow the employee to perform different jobs or different positions in their jobs. In the end in order to create successful adaptable employees school should teach what these personalities can do in different jobs at an early grade to impact the student's way of thinking to learn new skills and adapt to their"
7e37e5fe,0,"#Personal Career Plan: A Vision Statement -    Being a person who is not satisfied with what has already been achieved, I have a great number of career and educational goals that encourage me to invent new personal development strategies. In fact, it is difficult to prioritize over some of them as all opportunities are rather attractive. As for the primary career goals, after I leave the university, I would like to start my own business related to the travel industry or the restaurant industry as I am interested in both business areas.Nevertheless, I suppose that the second area of business involves more opportunities for development. I would like to start my business in Europe in order to broaden my horizons and fulfill one of my educational goals – gain new experience and learn how to apply the principles of entrepreneurship in countries other than the United Arab Emirates. More than that, I am planning to attend business courses to learn more about the chosen areas of business.Based on that, my long-term vision statement is the following: in 5-10 years, I am going to become an experienced entrepreneur and the owner of a popular restaurant chain in Europe. Personally, I suppose that my mission is to popularize Arabic food in European countries and, therefore, make people of different cultural backgrounds more interested in the values and traditions of my native country. As for values that I am going to act in accordance with when developing a business plan, they include the high quality of service, employee happiness, client satisfaction, innovation, and responsibility. The questions guiding my choices are the following:What can I do for society?What is the impact of my work?How can it be improved?External opportunities and threats remain an important question to be considered. People in Europe value cultural diversity, and this tendency is also manifested in their gastronomical predilections. This is the primary opportunity to help me to realize my mission. Also, I have an opportunity to refer to my friends’ experiences to avoid making common mistakes. As for threats, the global restaurant industry is highly competitive, and it will be necessary to develop a unique restaurant concept to meet with public notice. At the same time, some parts of the European population can associate the culture of the Middle East with terrorism, and the need to eliminate these biases is an additional threat.My personal strengths that will help me to achieve the goal are presented by developed analytical skills, a spacious mind, and the ability to make agreements with anyone. Despite that, I am going to gain new knowledge to become more inventive and communicate with people who have various cultural values. I would like to put emphasis on these skills to differentiate from other students and the entire population.The key milestones and checkpoints in my plan include finding business partners in Europe, developing a unique restaurant concept, conducting motivation research, and developing an effective marketing strategy. To define whether the milestones are attained, I am going to use industry reports, financial data, and opinion surveys and for me, being successful means getting support from customers and partners. External factors that can impact my success are presented by changing consumer purchasing power, changing food preferences, growing popularity of fast food, and the popularity of other restaurants that offer Arabic food.To mitigate threats related to competition and cultural bias, I am going to rely on the unique design of my future restaurants, combining Eastern and Western decorative elements. Even though it is extremely difficult to combine these two sets of cultural values due to the impact of religious beliefs, historical events, and the attitude to individual freedom, it is possible to use the elements of interior design that are popular in both cultures.It will help to achieve balance to ensure that Europeans perceive the culture and cuisine of the Middle East in a positive manner. Also, the unique design and diverse workforce are expected to help my future restaurant to distinguish itself from the restaurants of the key competitors. Also, it will be important to pay attention to diversity in staff selection to overcome threats related to competition.To practice ethical principles in my daily actions, I am going to be just and sincere when collaborating with my future business partners and protect the security of important information related to my partners, colleagues, and employees. The principles that I am going to use to create a successful team include evaluating people only based on their performance. In other words, I believe that any biases related to culture, religion, political orientation, and other similar factors should be eliminated, and the only way to shape an opinion concerning an employee is to evaluate his or her contribution to the success of a company.Practicing ethical principles is strictly interconnected with learning from one’s failures. In the past, I often had conflicts with people because of different points of view, and I understand that it was detrimental to our common goals. In the future, I am going to focus on goals when working with different people.There are people whose recommendations would be extremely important for me. The list of these people includes my best friend whose ideas are extremely creative, my cousin who can find the right words to support me, and my grandfather, who taught me to be honest. If summarized, my personal career plan would look like a “creative entrepreneur, responsible leader, reliable associate.”"

Each level of the hierarchy pyramid is a level of human needs that can be divided into deficiency needs and growth needs. Holland’s Theory of Career Choice is a code made of someone’s three dominant personality types out of six personality choices. This code identifies the personality types; realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, and conventional. With these dominant personality types chosen, it takes the participant one step closer to deciding what career type is right for them. Super’s Conception of Life Stages and Development Tasks describes career development through five life stages and sub stages. The main five stages are; growth, exploration, establishment, maintenance, and decline. This theory also stresses the centrality of self-concept as the driving force in career choice. Bandura’s Theory of Self-efficacy is the theory that if you believe in your success, it can play a major role in achieving goals and accomplishments.

According to Callahan and Garner (1997) career development is a dynamic process that requires individuals to engage in the ongoing assessment, analysis, and synthesis of information about the world of work and self.

d45a63d8,0,"#Self-Efficacy Beliefs and Career Development -    Self-Efficacy Beliefs and Career DevelopmentSelf-Efficacy Beliefs and Career DevelopmentStrategic interventions are required to keep young people who are disadvantaged because of poverty, cultural obstacles, or linguistic barriers from dropping out of school. Recent studies showing a relationship between a student's belief structure and behavior suggest that self-efficacy beliefs may be an important focus for intervention.This ERIC Digest discusses ways in which self-efficacy beliefs are influenced by various internal, external, and interactive factors and reflected in career-related outcome expectations and performance. It examines ways of channeling self-efficacy beliefs toward positive outcomes that lead to the development and expansion of career goals and expectations. It presents strategies for enhancing the self-efficacy and career development of students that draw upon contextual, problem-based, and community-based learning practices and promotes self-monitoring and self-assessment.Beliefs and PerceptionsAccording to Bandura (1977), self-efficacy is mediated by a person's beliefs or expectations about his/her capacity to accomplish certain tasks successfully or demonstrate certain behaviors (Hackett and Betz 1981). Bandura postulates that these expectations determine whether or not a certain behavior or performance will be attempted, the amount of effort the individual will contribute to the behavior, and how long the behavior will be sustained when obstacles are encountered (ibid.).Self-efficacy expectations, when viewed in relation to careers, refer to a person's beliefs regarding ""career-related behaviors, educational and occupational choice, and performance and persistence in the implementation of those choices"" (Betz and Hackett 1997, p. 383). They are reflected in an individual's perception about his/her ability to perform a given task or behavior (efficacy expectation) and his/her belief about the consequences of behavior or performance (outcome expectation)(Hackett and Betz 1981).The Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) developed by Lent, Hackett, and Brown (1996) draws upon Bandura's self-efficacy theory. It offers a framework for career development, explaining the interplay between educational and vocational interests, career-related choices, and performance. SCCT highlights the relationship among social cognitive variables (e.g., self-efficacy) and their relationship with other variables in the individual's socio-contextual environment, such as gender, race/culture, family, community, and political components (ibid.). Chen (1997) contends that this integration of self and social context offers an opportunity for individuals to gain a sense of control over their career development and increase their career-related self-efficacy expectations.Self-Efficacy and LearningWhen individuals have low self-efficacy expectations regarding their behavior, they limit the extent to which they participate in an endeavor and are more apt to give up at the first sign of difficulty.Suggests that efficacy-based interventions must increase the range of students' experiences and promote the personal and contextual factors that lead to high levels of self-efficacy.Recommends recognizing errors as natural and useful parts of the learning process, rather than as evidence of failure.Suggests that efficacy-based interventions must increase the range of students' experiences and promote the personal and contextual factors that lead to high levels of self-efficacy.Recommends recognizing errors as natural and useful parts of the learning process, rather than as evidence of failure.Explains that community-based learning experiences connect school work to career goals by involving students in solving real-world problems of the business community.Explains that contextual, problem-based, and community based learning practices provide opportunities for students to apply knowledge and skills in the same way they are used in real world, but their contribution to self-efficacy is embedded in reflection.Analyzes how self-efficacy beliefs are influenced by internal, external, and interactive factors and reflected in career-related outcome expectations and performance.Explains bandura's self-efficacy theory and the social cognitive career theory, which offers a framework for career development.Identifies four ways in which self-efficacy is learned and acquired: performance accomplishments, vicarious learning, verbal persuasion, and physical/affective status.Describes contextual learning as a process by which knowledge is socially shared, thinking is shaped by tools, and learning is situation specific.Explains that projects focus on real-world problems of relevance to students and community, and require effort and persistence over time. students develop an awareness of the educational requirements of an occupation and of career opportunities in the occupational area.Explains that the discussion and strategies presented in this digest can be applied to all students. however, students who must overcome internal and external barriers to self-efficacy are especially in need of positive learning experiences that guide them in overcoming real or perceived obstacles to career development.Explains the application of self-efficacy theory to the career assessment of women.Click here to unlock this and over one million essays"
c9797f93,0,"#Contrasting Views of Career Choices Amid the State of American Culture -   IntroductionThe stimulus quotes from Miller and D’Souza represent divergent insights about where American society is going and all that these imply for the career choices college students make. It is not, unhappily, a question of right or wrong beliefs or even a matter of one being more prevalent than the other because, on reflection, each author makes a valid case.The Desolate ViewBanal sameness – Michael Miller proceeds from his premise that the era of pioneering and inventiveness is over. America, he contends, has lost the spark of rugged individualism that brought it to greatness and settled for the safety of anonymous homogeneity. Taken at face value, this view has dire implications since it suggests Americans no longer have a fire in their bellies and that the baton of global leadership has passed on to other nations.On one level, this is really Miller taking a dim view of the United States sinking into a morass of consumerist mediocrity in employing the phrase “sterilized, automated contentment.” Manufacturers and service providers aggressively market a huge bounty of antiseptic, germ-free, sterile food and beverage; “crash-safe” cars that evoke Ralph Nader’s condemnation, “unsafe at any speed”; there is a great fuss made about the ideals of universal health coverage; California spends a great deal of money to coddle and counsel its crystal methamphetamine addicts, half the total in the States; and every appliance to promote convenient living is available. Dynamic dreams, Miller complains, have been supplanted by wanting sameness (“…standardized, replaceable…”) to the extent that every minority and fringe group bristle at the notion that they are different and beyond the moral pale. How else does one explain why “constitutional right” and “consenting adults” are excuses much bandied about?Dreams die hard – If the sub-prime mortgage collapse and ever-costlier gasoline have made acquiring a house and car a more remote proposition for Middle America, they can still be realized. In fact, there remain many exciting, popular and well-paying careers that belie the assertion of Miller about intellectually deadening and amoral professions. Going by such criteria as higher-than-average jobs growth and pay, sources like CNN’s Money magazine, Salary.com and CareerBuilder.com demonstrate that many of the more lucrative professions exemplify either intellectual stimulation, service to others or both. Certainly, there is a surfeit of such challenging careers: Software Engineer or Systems Analyst, Computer software engineers, Market research analyst, College professor, Computer IT analyst, Network systems and data communications analysts, Financial adviser, Real estate appraiser, Human Resources Manager, Physicians and surgeons, Physician assistant, Registered nurses, General and operations managers, Psychologists and Business operation specialists. There are surely more of the above than prosaic, mind-deadening jobs that also happen to pay above the median for America: Accountants and auditors, Maintenance and repair workers, or Carpenters.Exemplars – Ultimately, one acknowledges that the beauty of the American dream lies not in the tawdry sameness of suburban residential tracts, “big box” retailers, television fare and careers in sales. Rather it is exciting for being achievable at all for such great numbers in a nation now over 300 million strong. Far from chasing “standardized, replaceable and irrelevant” careers, today’s youth are inspired by the great achievers of our age, giants such as Steve Jobs, Ralph Ellison, Al Gore, Bill Gates and fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett, Kobe Bryant, Steven Spielberg and Barack Obama. There is hope yet.Infinite HorizonsD’Souza paints a romantic scenario of college as the time when young Americans learn to live independently and perforce make decisions on their own about careers they will follow. There is nothing new about such a starry-eyed and idyllic view because such has been the experience for centuries ever since the privileged young went off to university in medieval Europe. One must be careful about such a rose-colored view because there are mixed trends in the United States of today about just how widespread is the intent and privilege of going to college. But it is also undeniable that college is an unmatched leavening experience for the intellectual, moral and emotional strengthening of older adolescents and the youth.A democratic privilege – Most young Americans go on to college and, owing partly to market pressures, the number of adults with college degrees apparently continues to rise. The best intentions of the “No Child Left Behind” Act and the abundance of financial assistance or student loan programs notwithstanding, most of the rest are those who cannot or will not enter college.Early in the decade, the proportion of high school graduates who went on to college rose once again to reach close to two-thirds. This has to be an outstanding accomplishment by any benchmark, especially when one considers that most of the rest cannot afford to do so or simply prefer to be independent right away even if it means blue-collar work. Still others set their sights on being the next Venus Williams or Kobe Bryant, little knowing that the odds are against them.In total, the number of adults with college degrees continues to rise. As more and more companies require college graduates for even rank-and-file white-collar jobs, many respond positively by attending adult extension classes or online classes. Such a trend has also been given impetus by an unremitting wave of job losses as American industries outsource more and more work overseas.A coming of age – For everyone who makes it, college is truly a rite of passage. Free of daily scrutiny of parents and of legal age finally, college students are free to re-make their own lives. They indulge in cigarettes, drugs, drink and romantic relationships as much as their peers or their own mores will permit. For the first time, they are answerable to no one but remote deans of college and the police when they indulge in high-risk behavior like drunk driving. Such libertarian excess just never palls. Living the hard-bought heritage of women’s rights, coeds in particular discover the perils of risky acts that their male classmates naturally condone.At the same time, the juvenile career aspirations of middle school and junior college are subjected to the greater rigor of college academics and expectations all around to make adult decisions about the rest of their lives. In addition, exposure to visiting professionals, to professors with outside work and to internships all help refine many a career choice."
448404e1,0,"#Career in Healthcare Administration  Health care management and administration is a vital field in healthcare that relates to the governance and oversight of medical facilities and healthcare staff. Healthcare administrators are leaders within the healthcare sector that ensure the functionating of the department, medical practice, or hospital to which they are assigned. Their roles and responsibilities are vast and are aimed at facilitating the efficient work of a healthcare organization and the delivery of high-quality care to the patients of that facility. In summary, the main components of the work of a healthcare administrator include human resource management, leadership, financial and regulatory aspects, as well as information technology compliance.A healthcare administrator should have a variety of skills and competencies that will aid them in ensuring the efficient management of their facility. The priority of an administrator is to enable medical staff to perform in a way that is aligned with the federal and state laws and regulations and the ethical requirements of the medical profession. An administrator should be a competent leader and inspire their staff to work towards a common goal and achieve the personal goals they have set for themselves. They are required to stay informed on all legal requirements and be proficient in financial and human resource management and information technology issues. A healthcare administrator is also the figure at the hospital tasked with the responsibility of financially safeguarding their medical facility and ensuring care is provided to all patients who come there. In addition, the hospital’s day-to-day operation also falls under the responsibility of a healthcare administrator who should strive every day to improve efficiency and quality in delivering healthcare services to their community.Career in Healthcare AdministrationHealth care administration is the key field within the healthcare sector. Health care administrators or managers play a crucial role in the functioning of the hospital. They ensure that each member of staff is prepared to carry out duties and responsibilities assigned to them, coordinate work within the facility, and guarantee efficient communication with the community. Thus, healthcare administrators have unique roles and responsibilities within the healthcare system distinct from those of other healthcare professionals. This paper is dedicated to the roles, responsibilities, and priorities of healthcare administrators as stakeholders tasked with planning, directing, and coordinating medical and health services.Healthcare Administration Functions: Human ResourcesHuman resource management is one of the roles healthcare administrators are tasked with performing within a healthcare facility. Thus, it is the hospital administrator’s responsibility to oversee the recruitment, training, and supervision of staff members. They are also tasked with developing a schedule, ensuring the number of medical staff on duty each given shift addresses the needs of the medical facility. A healthcare administrator’s human resource management function includes financial and leadership components. Thus, administrators are involved in setting compensation and remuneration for hospital staff (Parayitam et al., 2021). Healthcare administrators are responsible for ensuring the ethical performance of the medical staff and their compliance with regulatory and legal guidelines. In case of an issue arising among the staff or between a member of staff and a patient, administrators need to act as a mediator and resolve the conflict. Thus, the main priority of a healthcare administrator is to facilitate the efficient functioning of the facility through the recruitment of the best-suited team.Financial AspectsThe role of a healthcare administrator also involves financial management. Besides staff remuneration and compensation of staff working in the medical facility, the administration is in charge of managing the finances of the facility, including patient fees and billing. According to Hernandez et al. (2018), the primary responsibility of the healthcare administrator is to ensure the healthy financial performance of their organization. Thus, the responsibilities of an administrator in the healthcare sector include the creation and review of all monetary statements. Communication with patients and insurance companies on financial matters such as billing is also the function of the administrator. Furthermore, financial decisions, such as the monetary benefit of performing an expensive medical procedure for the hospital, should also fall under the responsibility of the facility manager as they are tasked with assessing financial risks. Overall, the priority of an administrator is to ensure the hospital can financially support the delivery of care to as many patients as possible.Information TechnologyInformation technology is a vital part of modern-day healthcare. It is used in all its facets, including healthcare administration. In particular, information technology is implemented to maintain the healthcare records of all patients. The responsibility of a healthcare administrator is to keep all health records up to date. According to Kruse and Beane (2018), information technology contributes to the administrative efficiency of a medical facility and helps ensure improved health outcomes for patients. It should be noted that access to records is crucial for effective treatment and patient satisfaction and is critical in lawsuits against the hospital. Thus, it is the primary duty of a healthcare administrator to ensure all staff is trained to fill out electronic records and familiar with health information technology implemented at the facility.Regulatory AspectsThe field of healthcare administration also incorporates a regulatory aspect. It is the role of a healthcare administrator to stay up to date on the laws and regulations pertaining to the healthcare sector. Furthermore, the responsibility of an administrator is to ensure the medical staff working in their facility are informed of all changes in the regulations and guidelines concerning their practice. In addition, they are tasked with overseeing the performance of their medical professionals. A healthcare administrator has the moral and legal obligation to report all legal matters to the appropriate authorities. In summary, it is the propriety of a hospital manager to protect the patients from health risks and guarantee that the care of all patients is aligned with the legal guidelines and regulations.LeadershipAs professionals tasked with overseeing the functioning of an entire medical facility, healthcare administrators play a crucial leadership role. Administrators in a hospital are responsible for leading and uniting staff and ensuring a diverse community of healthcare workers is well-organized and capable of delivering high-quality care to patients. Therefore, healthcare administrators should be able to communicate with internal and external stakeholders and encourage individual and organizational accomplishment in order to achieve the shared vision (Pittman & Kolakowski, 2020). Administrators are responsible for the development of departmental and organizational goals and objectives and ensuring they are reached. The priority of professionals within the healthcare administration sector is to reconcile personal and organizational behaviors with the ethical requirements of the medical field (Pittman & Kolakowski, 2020). Thus, healthcare managers are responsible for setting goals and leading people to achieve those goals, as well as various personal goals medical staff may have."

Someone with an accounting education can pursue such career options as certified public accountant or an accounting clerk. Both of these are great career paths. A certified public accountant can work in many different areas and all kinds of companies (The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants n.d.). Certified public accountants could offer environmental, forensic and international accounting to their customers. The job of an accounting clerk is to review accounting records, calculate interests and keep track of balance. Accounting clerk should have a great understanding of computer programs because this job is associated with working with databases. Accountants and auditors that work in the sphere of business and financial operations have a relatively high percentage of employment of 36,58 percent in the United States (The Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2015). However, those working in the office only have a percentage of employment of 10,09 percent (The Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2015).Essential SkillsCertified public accountant provides a variety of services such as consulting and assurance, information technology services, and planning of taxes and finances. A certified public accountant has many responsibilities such as the forecast of revenue, investigation of variances, financial recommendations, creation and analysis of budgets, fiscal planning, review of the annual reports of their clients. Accountants should prove their professional competence by receiving a certificate from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Ragland and Ramachandran state that “AICPA provides a core competency framework for entry into the accounting profession that suggests accounting graduates must be able to use technology tools effectively and efficiently” (p.116). This means that any certified public accountant should have an excellent knowledge of modern computer software that is commonly used in this area. This career is highly reliant on the use of personal computers to better keep track of the information stored in various databases. A certified public accountant should have excellent thinking skills combined with logic. It is necessary for a certified public accountant to focus on target clients, and help them with matters such as investments and mergers. A certified public accountant will add significant value to the company because he or she will be able to provide it with many services, which are necessary for current business.ConclusionIn conclusion, there are various career options available for those with accountant education. There are such great job options as a certified public accountant and an accounting clerk. However, there are also some troubles associated with such careers. One must receive an additional certification to work as a certified public accountant. Sometimes there are problems with a license, and it is extremely problematic. Nevertheless, these are excellent career choices that offer great opportunities and are well paid."
2db622a5,0,"#Dual-Career Couple Policy in Organizations.  IntroductionThe organization recognizes, employs and supports dual-career couples, especially those who show commitment to the growth and success of the company.Definition: Dual career couplesDual-career couples refers to couples whose both parties are professionals and desire to work while they have family needs that require them to be located in a similar geographical area or the same organization.The policiesProvision of child-care assistanceThe company will provide day care services to dual-career couples and/or support in any way that is within the capability of the company the needs by for dual-career couples for child care.Assistance with employmentThe company will absorb a trailing partner if there was a vacant position or if it is possible to create one. Otherwise, the company will assist the trailing couple in the best way it can to get employment in other organization located in close proximity to the couples residential town. In some other circumstances the company will accept job sharing between the two parties of dual-career couples.Flexible time offThe company will provide time off to dual-career couples as sick leave and vacation leave. These two leaves can be combined if a couple request so. Again, the leave time that is not utilized can be carried forward according to the couples wish.Conflict of interestEach person sharing an appointment will be entitled to a full vote in faculty meetings, and either or both may assume administrative functions, but neither may vote on personnel matters that would affect the other’s rank or status, and neither may assume responsibility for making decisions regarding conditions of the other’s employment. Both people sharing an appointment will not ordinarily serve on the same committee.Misuse of dual-career couples privilegesThe privileges given to the dual-career couples should not be misused in any way. In the event that the employees are found to be taking advantage of these provision tough measures will be taken against them.AnalysisThe contents of this policy highlight some areas that the company considers to implement in consideration of dual-career couples where each item has its own consequences.The company supports the dual-career couples because they are beneficial to the organization. According to studies, dual- carer couples working in the same companies have (in general terms) similar goals and objectives, have greater commitment to an organization than ordinary employees, and are known to have the will to work long hours at the work. A policy that recognizes and is pro dual-career couples therefore help in attracting and retaining productive employees.The provision of child-care assistance, assistance with employment, and allowing a flexible-time off presents some financial burden to the company. One, the company would incurs expenses in implementation of the day-care services. Moreover, assistance of the dual-career couples to find employment for the trailing spouses may translate into spending money for travelling and communication expenses. Worse is that the efforts of the company to assist the dual-career couple may not yield good results in time resulting to extended expenditure by the company; it can also result to the loss of employed party of the dual-career couple. Allowing a flexible-time off is a recipe for temporary loss of manpower for the company which has its consequences."
f7fd3039,0,"#Choice of career between Accounting Manager and Accounting Auditor -   Report ExampleIntroductionThe accountancy career is gaining popularity with each passing day as new businesses open doors for professionals in this field. In addition, the increasing number of companies all over the world, which are replacing sole proprietorship entities, has also led to increased demand for accountants. As a result, many people are taking advantage of this great opportunity. In this field, one may choose to specialize in one of the many disciplines available (Seybert, 2010).This move calls for guidance to advise those seeking to venture into the career. The roles played by management accountants and auditors differ greatly. The role of an accounts manager is to interpret financial information and then advise the management on the right decision to make. Accounts managers are not the same as financial accountants, as the former are more involved in decision-making of the company as compared to the latter.In some cases, they supervise the financial accountants (Bedard, Chtourou, & Courteau, 2004). On the other hand, auditors are tasked with the responsibility of revising the financial accounts prepared by financial accountants to ensure that they represent “a true and fair view of the company’s financial position” (Bedard et al., 2004, p. 24).They are also obliged to prepare a report and present it to the shareholders of the company during the annual general meetings. This report is meant to offer career guidance to graduates in the accounting sector. It analyzes both management accountants and the auditors’ roles in private companies and gives recommendations on the better choice between the two. Chances of PromotionIt is quite possible for a management accountant to rise to the role of financial controller, which is superior and better paying. In this position, the accountant will be entrusted with the mandate of overseeing all the affairs of the company coupled with being responsible for all decision involving financial transactions.An accountant in this managerial position will not only have a chance to gain experience in different fields, but also will get an opportunity to explore different talents as opposed to an auditor whose role is limited to that of checking accounts prepared by others.A managerial accountant has the opportunity to visit different places as a representative of the company not to mention the powers conferred to him or her to represent the firm in contractual matters. A good example of such contract is a contract involving mergers and acquisition, which if successfully entered means high controlling power on the part of the managing accountant, and thus higher pay (Tayles, Pike, & Sofian, 2007). However, this development will not affect the position of an auditor.SalaryAn accountant manager is entitled to a higher pay as compared to an auditor if this aspect were to be decided on a quantum merit basis. An accountant manager is in charge of the day-to-day running of the business and he or she has to be consulted regularly on management decisions.Therefore, indisputably, a management accountant is usually over tasked as the survival of the company depends on him or her and thus s/he is entitled to a higher reward. Going by the laws governing the operation of companies, auditor’s fee is subject to discussion and determination by shareholders in an Annual General Meeting (AGM) (Desai, Hogan, & Wilkins, 2006).Conventionally, there exists a conflict of interest between shareholders and auditors (as shareholders would want to maximize their profits at the expense of the auditors). Therefore, it follows that shareholders will not be willing to pay much to auditors. In addition, shareholders’ decision on the auditors’ salary is final and it cannot be reviewed upwards at anytime during the financial period on the grounds of increased responsibilities.Job securityThe law governing the formation and operation of companies requires auditors of a company to be appointed under the guidance and determination of shareholders in an AGM. They are appointed to serve for a period of one year and upon expiry of this period, they can either be reappointed or laid off by the same authority. This aspect means that an auditor’s job is at the mercy of the shareholders and it can be terminated at a general meeting via a simple majority.In the view of these facts, auditors thus have little job security. On the other hand, accounts managers, have immunity against removal by shareholders, as their job is not based on contract as the case of auditors. This assertion implies that their job can only be terminated under the grounds of incapacitation, incompetence, or other reasonable grounds like fraud (Bedard et al., 2004).Scope of workAn account manager is tasked with the responsibility of ensuring that proper accounts are maintained throughout the financial year. Conventionally, his or her role extends to that of management. He or she is also tasked with the role of analyzing investments for decision-making.This multitasking equips an accounts manager with the actual management skills and experience, which may earn him or her even a more senior position in a company. On the other hand, the role of auditors is limited to reviewing the accounts prepared by the accountants in a company to determine if they portray a true and fair view of the company’s financial position coupled with whether they have been prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles.This aspect creates monotony of job, and thus boredom hence denying auditors the opportunity to explore and gain experience in other areas involving accountancy and management, which may be crucial to their career development (Shan, 2007).Working hoursThe growth of a company rests on its executives. They have to spend most of their time in the business premises in a bid to oversee the company’s operations. An accounts manager, being closely involved in the management of the company, will thus be expected to spend all his or her time within the business premises.This aspect may also include overtime at times when there is extra work especially during the auditing period. This element means that the accounts manager will not have time for leisure or to carry his or her own business, hence he or she will have to work for the standard hours from Monday to Friday (Seybert, 2010).On the other hand, auditors are only tasked with the responsibility of examining financial statements prepared by some other people and their role is only limited to cross-examining the accounts and reporting any misrepresentation to shareholders and other interested parties. Due to this reduced role, they do not spend all their time in their places of work, and thus they have ample time to engage in other personal issues.LiabilityAuditors are expected to carry out their tasks in a professional manner and exercise due care when reporting on their findings. They may be held personally liable to users of the accounts prepared and approved by them regardless of whether or not the misrepresentation originated from the management. They can be called upon to account for any loss suffered by a person who proves to have relied on the accounts when contracting with the company.Lack of clear rules protecting the auditor from personal liability arising out of management’s negligence further inflates this problem (Collin, Tagesson, Andersson, Cato, & Hansson, 2009). The law protects accounting managers from being held personally liable for their acts as long as they these acts are within their powers. They are deemed to act on behalf of the company, and thus they cannot be held personally liable for these acts.RecommendationsIn my opinion, in light of the reasons that have been discussed in this paper, an employee or student seeking to enter into accountancy career should go for an accounts manager position as opposed to an auditor’s one in a bid to reap the benefits that have already been discussed herein.The benefits of holding the accounts manager’s position outnumber those accruing from holding an auditor’s position. However, this realization should not discourage those who would like to specialize in auditing work as there also exists an opportunity for them to rise to the position of accounts managers in the end. However, the best option would be to pursue accounts management as this option offers greater opportunities both in the short-run and in the long term."
87055d2f,0,"#The Transition From School to Work  -    IntroductionThe transition from school to work can be a very challenging task for a person. In particular, it may be difficult for this individual to adjust to the new schedule or the requirements set by the employer. Furthermore, he/she may not be accustomed to working overtime. In many cases, these people should change their lifestyles. Overall, one can offer several recommendations that can help college and university graduates.Main bodyAt first, they need to learn as much as possible about the requirements that are set for people who apply for a particular position (Sweeney, 2014). For instance, they should read detailed job descriptions that specify the duties and responsibilities of employees. Additionally, they can read various articles that describe the experiences of new hires as well as the common mistakes that these people tend to make. In this way, they can better anticipate potential problems.Additionally, they should pay more attention to their schedule and time management. For instance, they should ensure that they have good sleep; otherwise, their performance can be impaired considerably. Additionally, they need to set aside their activities on various social networks because they can prevent them from doing their workplace tasks.Furthermore, young people should be aware of such a problem as information overload. It occurs when people need to memorize a great number of details within a very short time (Buhler, 2002). For instance, new hires may learn about workplace procedures, electronic passwords, performance standards, documentation, and so forth. Therefore, they should write everything down, at least, during the first few days of their work.Additionally, some problems can occur when young people try to show that they can cope with every task without relying on the assistance of their co-workers. In this way, they want to highlight their self-sufficiency. Unfortunately, in some cases, they can make costly mistakes. Therefore, they should consult their managers or mentors. In this way, young employees can find more efficient solutions to the problems that they can face at the beginning of their career. Moreover, young people should become accustomed to teamwork that is one of the prerequisites for their success.Furthermore, college graduates should bear in mind that modern companies can be run by people who have different attitudes, values, and behavioral norms (Parry, 2014). In particular, they should not overlook the importance of generational differences. For example, older may not approve of the casual clothing style favored by young employees. Furthermore, they do not expect new hires to discuss the work on social networks. In fact, this behavior can sometimes violate the confidentiality rules adopted by companies. So college graduates should learn more about behavioral norms established in the organization.There is another risk that should not be overlooked. Employers can set very high-performance standards for new hires. So, they often need to work overtime. In some cases, they may not maintain regular contact with their friends or relatives. Nevertheless, young people should remember that such contracts are necessary for their resilience to various stressors (Decvar, 2012, p. 349). For instance, these relations can help them cope with burnout (Decvar, 2012).ConclusionAdmittedly, these recommendations cannot cover every potential difficulty that a person can encounter in the workplace. Nevertheless, they can help avoid many pitfalls that can impair people’s experiences at the beginning of their careers. They are useful for dealing with such issues as the need to work overtime, information overload, and stress. They are also helpful for avoiding conflicts and misunderstandings.Reference ListBuhler, P. (2002).

5ad56b9c,0,"#Career Counseling Over the Lifespan -   Career Counseling Over the LifespanAbstractCareer counseling over the lifespan has more than an occupational focus, it deals with the person’s entire being with a vision that includes one’s lifespan.  Career counseling takes into consideration character development, character skills, life roles, individual life and work history, goals, and obstacles.  A career counselor not only assists a client with a career plan, but also with a life plan.  This paper focuses on two categories of career counseling.  The first focus is the history of career counseling as a field of study with the emphasis on when and why career counseling began (1800s as a study of how the shape of one’s head relates to vocational choice), who and what influenced it (Sizer, Parsons, and Davis), and how it has changed (from an individual/community vocational view to an individual/world lifespan view).  The second focus is on the application of career counseling by researching two leaders, John Holland’s and Donald Super’s, contributions to career counseling, their theories and assessments and on the biblical aspects of career counseling and how each theory relates to the Bible.Career Counseling Over the LifespanSeeking the services of a career counselor can provide many benefits.  One can gain a deeper understanding of him/herself, gain information on education and careers, gain sills in decision-making, gain support in conducting a job search or applying to higher education, and gain support coping with career transitions (NCDA, “Why Seek Career Counseling, 2007).

used as a model to examine the influences of spiritual factors. holland’s person-environment theory might not always be supported by biblical examples.Opines that a biblical approach to career counseling, an inventory that considers biblical self-awareness, and the connection of god’s provision of grace to complete work, might provide people with broader views of work being anointed and

044e64a9,0,"#Business Ethics: Career Ambition vs. Company Goals  The case study indicates that Linda Forbes is a self-driven, hardworking, and motivated person who seeks to achieve her professional and career goals. Forbes has managed to develop a conclusive study that explores the prospects of the autonomous transportation industry. The research director at HIG Capital LLC, Norman Driver, is already contented with her gains and achievements. The agreement established between the company and Forbes appears to be symbiotic because she will realize her goals while at the same time supporting the organization’s agenda (Hasnas 298). The dilemma has emerged after Dylan Lubbock has approached Forbes to provide a more comprehensive report for Crosslink Capital.If I were in Linda Forbes, I would focus on the original agreement since it is the most acceptable thing to do (Schwartz 32). It would be appropriate to tell Dylan Lubbock that the proposal is dishonorable since she has been using HIG Capital LLC’s resources to conduct the study. The move can guide the CEO to realize how his suggestion might affect Forbes’ relationship with HIG Capital LLC.Employees should uphold the best values and ethical principles whenever supporting the needs of their respective firms. Linda Forbes should be on the frontline to support the goals and objectives of HIG Capital LLC. The agreement between the company and the employee is binding. This means that Forbes should focus on the most apposite actions that would support the agreement (Schwartz 47). By so doing, Forbes will support the mission of the targeted company.Ethical theory discourages the application of predatory practices, especially in the world of business. This situation and understanding would persuade Forbes to decline the offer. This resolution is necessary because the offer has the potential to affect the firm’s business model. Linda Forbes should complete the research study sponsored by HIG Capital LLC before establishing a new relationship with Crosslink Capital. The guiding principle for this argument is that a given action should be pursued if only it delivers positive or desirable outcomes (Hasnas 291). Determinations should be deemed ethical if they would be favorable to the greatest number of people. Any attempt to sign a deal with Dylan Lubbock will undermine the company’s objectives.Failing to agree with Lubbock is the most appropriate ethical decision. This action is desirable since it seeks to support what ought to be right. A predatory practice in the world of business is something unethical (Joseph 14). Being in Linda Forbes’ shoes, I will mainly focus on my initial goals while at the same time supporting the goals of the targeted company. The move will make it easier for Forbes to realize her potential.Works CitedHasnas, John. “Teaching Business Ethics: The Principles Approach.” Journal of Business Ethics Education, vol. 10, no. 1, 2013, pp. 275-304.Joseph, George. “Theoretical Perspectives on Ethical Dilemmas in Globalization and International Taxation.” Journal of Accounting, Ethics and Public Policy, vol. 17, no. 3, 2016, pp. 1-37.Schwartz, Mark S.

aa273232,0,"#Database Administrator as a Career Choice -   Research Paper ExampleThe dramatic increase in the use of computers and informational technology has boosted the need for highly skilled professionals related to various dimensions of these fields. Some of the opportunities are in areas of computer research, database administration, and network systems, and data communication analysis (Computer Scientists, p. 1). Rapid developments in related technologies have further increased the scope of opportunities and job functions in these areas (Computer Scientists, p. 1). My fascination with computers and the vast information that is available on the Internet has made me incline towards knowing the manner in which the data is maintained and updated from time to time. I believe that the knowledge I have gained in this regard can be highly useful if I choose to work as a database administrator. My desire to learn more in this field will also be fulfilled by choosing this career path.Tasks and Responsibilities of the JobComing to the job functions of a database administrator, they include database management with regards to data integrity, backup systems, and database security, among others (Computer Scientists). The general functions of this category are mentioned below.Database administrators have to deal with database management software, with strong expertise in database development, organization, and storage (Computer Scientists, p. 1; Database, p. 1).They have to analyze user needs, maintain existing computer databases and set up new ones accordingly (Computer Scientists, p. 1). A part of it is to integrate data from older systems into a new system as and when needed (Computer Scientists, p. 1).Also, they are responsible to assess and manage system modifications while troubleshooting problems (Computer Scientists 1). To be precise, they need to be good at database modeling and design (Database, p. 1).They may be required to use “data mapping, data mining, and data transformational analysis tools for database development, design, and maintenance” (Database, p. 1).They have to be good at understanding the database platforms to enable the required performance of the system while making time to time adjustments (Computer Scientists, p. 1).Some added responsibilities may be included with respect to user requirements, necessary specifications, design protocols, and developmental schedules (Database, p. 1).Most importantly, the increasing connectivity of databases with the Internet requires these administrators to coordinate with network administrators in order to maintain proper security measures for database maintenance (Computer Scientists, p. 1).Work Environment and Job ScopeThough expanding computer networks allow database administrators to work through laptops, email, and the Internet, they generally work in offices using their computers for about 40 hours per week (Database 1). While some of these professionals work as contractors or consultants, the remaining are recruited by various employers such as governments, insurance companies, financial institutions, universities, and computer product manufacturers (Database, p. 1).It is expected that the lack of skilled professionals to meet increasing demands in this field will provide excellent job opportunities for these professionals over the next decade (Computer Scientists, p. 1). Out of 542,000 computer specialists that were employed in May 2006, nearly 119,000 were database administrators (Computer Scientists, p. 1). The salaries for database administrators for 2007 ranged between $70,250 and $102,000 per annum with scope for further increase up to $84,750-$116000 depending on skill level and promotions (Computer Scientists, p. 1).Required Skills and Educational BackgroundTo get high-paying jobs, database administrators require having commendable knowledge in programs, along with exceptional communication and interpersonal skills (Database, p. 1). However, required educational qualifications may vary depending on respective positions and companies. Most of the companies require a Bachelors’s degree in Management Information systems (MIS), computer science, or information science, whereas other companies may need only a two-year relevant degree (Database, p. 1). Moreover, relevant job experience and internships are seen as advantageous (Database, p.1). However, a doctorate is required for those who want to work in research areas (Database, p. 1).Also, an MBA with a special focus on information systems is an added qualification to get into companies that are expanding their business to the internet (Database, p. 1). Apart from this, certification as a specialist in a particular aspect of database administration is becoming a key requirement to join some companies (Database, p. 1). To be precise, the increasing complexity of the business arena is resulting in the company’s tendency to look for candidates who have expertise inside and outside the IT arena (Computer Scientists, p. 1).My Skills and Educational BackgroundI believe that I have the required knowledge and skill level to start my career as a database administrator. Attending computer technology classes at the Laguardia community college, New York, helped me gain knowledge about computers, software development, and database management. Moreover, I have taken telecommunications as my major helps me learn further about computers, communications, and designing voice and data communication systems. This knowledge will also help me in further expanding my job prospects, as I can have good chances in database administration related to the telecommunications field, and vice versa.However, with the increasing developments in technology, I need to be well acquainted with the latest advancements so as to increase my job opportunities and fulfill my desire to become excellent in the field. Also, as companies look for candidates with special certificates, I want to get a certificate course in my favorite database security from a recognized private company. Apart from this, my immediate step will be to get an internship to gain practical experience and further improve my knowledge in various aspects of database administration.Finally, researching for this paper has helped me to concentrate in detail on database administration in view of career prospects. This will surely help me streamline my plans and efforts in order to become a highly-skilled database administrator who can meet the requirements of the industry.ConclusionThere are increasing job opportunities for database administrators. However, potential candidates need to possess various skills along with relevant educational qualifications in order to meet companies’ requirements in the increasingly complex business arena.Works Cited"
2de11442,0,"#Evaluating Career Choice Arguments -    Presentation ExampleThe two most compelling argumentsMost compelling arguments are:The one with a logical error in it but is still important:Considering a career in education since it is the best way to make a difference in the world.The most compelling arguments are those of the grandmother and the father. These tow arguments engage the listener or the reader into deep thoughts of their truthfulness. They cannot be easily dismissed unless one thinks of them critically. This is why I selected them as the most compelling arguments.The statement by the mother has a logical error but can still be considered important.Errors in truth within the argumentsThe statements have:It is false to link:The first selected argument (that of the grandmother), may be compelling but has an error in truth. The argument has an informal fallacy based on its strong inference. Such inductive arguments can never be absolutely true or entirely useless. Since this argument recommends its conclusion with a greater degree of probability, it can be said to be strong.The second argument made by the father tends to link infinite career options to business career choices. Such an argument has a false premise which makes the conclusion to be false. Despite having some degree of probability, the argument can be misinterpreted.The image illustrate another example of an argument with a logical error.Errors in validityValid arguments must have:True premises;True conclusions (Goodwin, 2000).The second argument has an error of validity:It has false conclusion;It also has false premises.The first argument has valid premise but false conclusion.The one error of validity identified in the arguments is that of false premises and conclusions. If the individual being referred to has interest in music he cannot select a career in business or education. But the first argument has a logical premise. The individual is requested to select a career in whatever area he is interested in.Logical restatement of the argumentsThe first argument can be restated as follows:You need to select a career you love because you will always enjoy your work.The second statement can be restated as follows:You need to consider a career in business because it will expand your career options.The restatements of these two argument increases the degree of their probability in addition to validating both the premises and the conclusion. The statements are now more logical and can be used to convince someone into the individual action.Criteria used for evaluationThe criteria used is based on the concept of argument mapping (Paul & Elder, 2008).The purpose of mapping is to uncover the logical structure of the arguments (Timo, et al., 2009).The process of mapping looked at:Conclusion;The reason;Premise;Objection;Rebuttal.The steps can be used for evaluating all arguments. Argument mapping can be used to show the logical structure of statements. It achieves this through breaking up the arguments into its constituents claims and identifying the relationships between the claims."
bdddc9c8,0,"#Social Factors of Educational and Career Choices -   Social constructs are an impactful factor that determines the demographics in career choices, including family structures. In particular, Flores (2018) criticized the assumption that specific communities have monolithic identities that create gendered career influences based on culture. Instead, he stated that “family forms are shaped by the adaptations of family members to the social situations in which they are embedded,” reflecting on the changes in parental messages relative to life circumstances (Flores, 2018:4). Hence, there was a gradual dissolution of the assumption that Latino women were prone to choosing pink collar jobs traditionally based on the sociocultural construct that women nurture and care for the home. However, Latinas have demonstrated a varying trend in advancing into non-traditional positions in medicine influenced by parental messages (Flores, 2018). Modern trends show that immigrant parents encourage education as a path to financial independence from men as their mothers advise the adaptive discouraging dependence on the man. Conversely, fathers encouraged the same independence to their daughters to seek opportunities that they lacked as immigrants (Flores, 2018). As such, the concept deviates from traditional assumptions to expand the conceptualization of gender and other social factors.The idea most reflective of my experiences is the masculinity privilege that instigates academic gender gaps. Morris (2008) highlighted the academic differences in that girls were more successful in education than boys in society. He presented that the difference was not a bias or disadvantage based on gender but a construct of masculinity employed by boys. Inadvertently, boys develop masculinity privileges that detract from academic efforts. As such, among my peers, it was more acknowledgeable when a boy performed in sports comparable to education, focusing on getting drafted for sports scholarships. The concept can be employed in my current life in sensitizing those around me to dispel the thought that educational achievement is emasculated. Conclusively, these social constructs relating to disadvantaged groups of society influence occupational choices deviating from the traditional constructs evolving with changes in life experiences."
c9c60712,0,"#Personal Development in Hospitality Management -    IntroductionIn today’s environment, hospitality students who finish pursuing education often face difficulties in finding suitable jobs due to the competition in the job market. Hospitality students are expected to meet the challenges imposed by the prospective employers in the context of their education being relevant to the industry. Most of the academic programs in the hospitality sector are designed to teach students the techniques and skills that will keep them in high stead while performing their hospitality jobs. The main aim of these programs is to enable students to be able to manage the fast-changing expectations of such jobs in the highly competitive hospitality sector, which entails the management of employer demands and fast-changing consumer attitudes.Main bodyAccording to Johnstone (1994), there is a big gap in terms of employer expectations and formal education and training in the hospitality industry. He has stressed the need for academic institutions to address the skills, which are a necessity for such students to incorporate, and which are presently being left for employers to handle. Most employers in the hospitality sector feel that several skills in the sector should have been taught in the academic institutions at undergraduate levels and that there is an immediate need for hospitality education to incorporate such changing demands of the industry. The hospitality sector works in a very challenging environment, which requires catering to a continuous and swift change of consumer patterns. Hence hospitality education programs must be flexible in adapting within their curriculum such changes in the educational content as also in enabling the students to imbibe the required skills and knowledge to meet up to the job expectations.Research by Goodman and Sprague (1991) has shown that those students of hospitality who have a strong base understanding and knowledge of the industry will fare much better in the long term and prove to be of advantage to employers also. The present education levels do not fully meet the expectations of the hospitality industry and if the education can be modified in a calculated manner it would surely result in bringing about solutions in terms of the content and skills matching the industry needs. The ultimate goal of the education programs in the hospitality sector should be to equip students with the abilities to meet contemporary knowledge and skill as required by a quickly changing and competitive hospitality sector. It is quite evident that the need for hospitality education arose given the requirement of competent professionals in the hospitality sector, which was driven by high industry standards. According to Nelson and Dobson (2001), the success of hospitality education programs is determined by the quality of graduates from these institutions as also their retention rate within the industry. Unfortunately, most of the hospitality programs today lack the generality of business perspectives (Pavesic 1991), and there have been several curriculum issues debated regarding hospitality literature mainly due to the field of study being new in comparison to other areas of education. Consequently, there have been constant attempts in reconstructing the curriculum in this regard to meet the needs of the industry. Reigal (1991) has researched that there are three key elements to hospitality education, which are skills, values, and substantive knowledge. According to him, substantive knowledge is the most important in enabling the practice of the profession, skills provide the student with competency to use the knowledge in practice and the value component equips the student to adapt values essential for success in this industry.Some theorists believe that hospitality education is not up to the mark and is in danger of losing its importance just as education in other fields such as banking, insurance, and transport, which have over time been absorbed as being part of the general business programs. It is in this context that Michael Haywood (1989) has said that, “Education must adapt itself and its role to retain its effectiveness. Educators must now explore the prospects for an educational design that enable students to prepare for continuing learning and participation in the transformation of their personal lives, their careers, and their society.” According to Pavesic (1993), some hospitality education programs are faulty in being extra theoretical or are like advocating too much industry focus in the curriculum with too much technical orientation. In consequence, the industry expectation of there being a standard foundation in students is not fulfilled.An academic requirement of hospitality students is the inclusion of a course in principles of management whereby students will be required to create a real-life plan for business and to implement it along with lab studies which will require them to do research, planning, and implementation of business plans to give students a real-world experience regarding the expectations from them. The stress needs to be more on experiential learning which will give students the real-world environment and the opportunity to put their skills to test, as also to learn from their mistakes and feel good about their achievements in this regard (Crockett 2002). Breiter and Clements (1998) concluded in a study that there are three basic skills required by recruiters in the hospitality industry, which pertain to skills in leadership, employee relations, and managerial communication. In this context, it is clear that more than academic pursuits, the hospitality student needs to imbibe expertise in these three areas so that he can prove himself as effective hospitality professional. The curriculum in hospitality institutions must encourage the development of such traits by using a combination of relevant techniques. Educators must keep the expectation of the hospitality industry in mind so that students become innovators of the future in enabling the provision of the demands of the industry. Essentially excellent conceptual and human skills are the key components required to be made as an integral part of the education process.The hospitality industry seeks talent that is skilled in enabling the productive activities entailed in the different elements of the tourism and hospitality sector and there is a strong need to change the present content of hospitality education so that new entrants can keep pace with the industry trends. Hence there has to be more emphasis on education to keep pace with the changing requirements. There is presently a big difference between what the hospitality education system offers and the expectations of the hospitality industry. Employers have indicated that most of the skills required of a hospitality professional are learned at the workplace and the formal education at best gives theoretical insight about hospitality and its percentage of the total learning process is very less, and despite this fact hospitality education institutions are still giving more emphasis on carrying this process to higher levels. Hence the pattern is now emerging that the hospitality sector is assuming higher responsibility in educating employees by offering a curriculum agenda in keeping with the demands of the industry. The vital aspects of a hospitality job cannot be fully integrated with the student by academic studies alone, hence the change in industry patterns of involving the workplace as a learning ground for students. Most of the hospitality requirements that can be mastered at the workplace are employee relations, problem resolution, leadership, employee training, internship, food and beverage management, operational controls, guest services, and managerial communications. Indeed, all these skills are much better learned on the job than as an academic area of study. Academic studies in hospitality pertain to different levels of research activities, the law relating to hospitality, tourism promotion, strategic and development planning. The academic curriculum has to be amended to accommodate the use of laptops to enhance the ability of the student to use technologies and educational deliveries of the concepts of the industry from the technological viewpoints.ConclusionThere are limitations in corporate budgets and so is the case with educational institutions that are facing financial pressures and budget constraints in fulfilling the flow of extra demands on their curriculum. Hence there is a need for educational institutions in hospitality to review, refine and focus on the specific use of the present systems as also on each course, which is being offered in the context of educational settings and expectations. Especially in the hospitality sector, there is a strong need for the industry and educational institutions to partner in providing competent professionals to meet the rising demand for them in the competitive environment. This is all the more necessary now given cuts in budgetary expansions while the demand keeps growing for qualified and competent staff."
73924ccb,0,"#Ethical Approaches in Career Choice  IntroductionHappiness is the best thing that an individual can have in life. One cannot find it unless he or she has a meaningful life. Immanuel Kant reveals how people need to fill their life with activities. Work is part of such activities that Immanuel Kant refers. He claims that work should be a beneficial career that has a rationale. In the contemporary age, people have chosen careers that have a sole interest of making money while not considering the business environment and their personal interest towards the career. Nonetheless, empirical evidence and theoretical approaches have indicated that life satisfaction is not significantly affected by the amount of income. Other facets such as family and friends come in handy. With time, individuals get exhausted with the career, although they remain enslaved in their occupations because they are left with no viable option. Poor choice of career by individuals affects the entire economy. Besides, it derails development. Therefore, individuals have a responsibility to make moral choices when deciding the career they desire to pursue. This paper discusses some of the ethical choices that people should consider when deciding their occupations. The premise is that since work is an important element of life, it contributes to one’s happiness.Making Ethical Career ChoicesBefore determining how one can make an ethical selection when choosing a career, it is imperative to understand the meaning of a career. With respect to this discussion, a career refers to a prolonged project for a person’s life. A profession may be in different fields such as law, entrepreneurship, certified benevolence, medicine, and entertainment among others. It is not necessarily that one earns income from his or her career. One’s career becomes part of his or her life. It often helps him or her to achieve a particular purpose. A career involves mental, physical, and emotional investment for the pursuit of being successful. One may be required to live in a particular location, behave in a particular manner, and/or receive a certain knowledge and skills to work on his or her career. These terms may alter one’s lifestyle by making it worse or better than before. Notably, career may not determine every component in an individual’s life. Indeed, it limits the manner in which a person may prosper or behave. Hence, career choice cannot be disregarded in the group of the main decisions that a human being makes. As Chan, Fung, and Yau confirm, the type of job that an individual chooses can answer the popular Socratic question of the type of life that an individual should live1.People should note that their career choice might affect their future life since they will have invested their energy and time. Thus, anyone who is deciding on which career to pick should note that his or her decision might affect his or her future multiple years. Nonetheless, a question may be raised on whether it is compulsory to have a career. One may claim that there are people who do various businesses in life and end up becoming richer and happier than those who chose a particular career. Furthermore, others may choose a career in crime and evil things, which please them. However, careers can be used to meet moral values of the society because the energy and time that people invest in a given career can be used to transform many lives, including the life of the pursuer. Hence, careers can become a channel of self-identification and/or reaching out to the community. The problem of choosing career exists in a society that has a range of opportunities. Hence, as Shafer-Landau confirms, an individual is forced to choose a particular career out of several options unlike in a society that is characterized by only one career2.People should choose careers that make them happy because happiness has been found to be one of the main components of wellbeing. It affects the manner in which people interact with others in the society, their conduct, and the way in which they resolve challenges that emerge in life. Nonetheless, people’s environment and challenges that they go through affect their happiness. A prosperous life only requires three things, namely friends, financial stability, and liberty. Anyone who requires more than these three elements is brainwashed. Other scholars such as Shafer-Landau have specified five major needs in life that one’s career must satisfy. An occupation should respond to physiological, security, realization and participation, esteem, and self-accomplishment needs. People get utility from their careers, which then lead to life satisfaction. The implication is that unemployed people are unhappy because they experience depression, low self-esteem, and apprehension. Income only plays a partial role in happiness building, although it is the ultimate source of happiness. Thus, it should not be the main reason for choosing a job as Ugwuoke confirms3.The role of money in creating happiness is minute. This claim can be easily explained by the fact that the standard of happiness of citizens is not in tandem with the GNP of a country. Over the years, theorists have developed philosophies on how to reach ethical career decisions. Some of these theories encourage choosing a career that promotes charity. For instance, according to Shafer-Landau, consequentialist theorists assert that it is wise for people to choose careers that have high returns so that people can get enough resources to assist others who are in need4. Natural law theories as well as virtue ethics encourage the need to consider character development in career choice such that people should prefer positive-oriented careers to negatively motivated occupations. In essence, virtue ethics scholars claim that human dignity should be one of the main considerations when choosing a career. The subsequent discussion will give a deeper insight on the theories that address the choosing of a career on ethical grounds.Consequentialism and Career ChoiceThe consequentialist ethical approach maintains that a conduct can only be declared good or bad based on the results that an individual demonstrates. One of the popular theories under this approach is the utilitarian theory, which holds that people should do acts that promote the greatest pleasure for the greatest number of individuals. For instance, in the case of a job, it should benefit the highest number of people such as relatives and citizens. Other theories under consequentialism include ethical egoism, which holds that consequences are to be evaluated in line with the profit that an actor gains from the conduct. Consequentialist principles normally address three elements that pertain to morality. The first element is the principle of right. It claims that an act is right if it promotes good. Secondly, it defines what is good as any act, which causes happiness, brings wealth and authority, and promotes impressive character. Thirdly, it raises the questions on whose goodness is relevant, whether that of the society or an individual as Ciulla confirms5.UtilitarianismAccording to Birsch, under utilitarianism, one simply computes the advantages and expenses of doing a particular action6. He or she then evaluates the outcomes. If the action benefits a great number of people, it is deemed good. In essence, utilitarianism can be termed as a monistic ethical theory because it mostly focuses on mental satisfaction. Nonetheless, divergent opinions have been raised concerning the source of satisfaction, thus causing the emergence of other utilitarian subgroups. Utilitarianism is largely accepted in the western culture because of the development of science, technology, Christianity, and egalitarianist ideologies of love.The description of good and evil is indefinite due to the existing conflict among utilitarians, namely hedonistic, eudaimonistic, and ideal utilitarians. Hedonistic utilitarians hold that the good or evil can be determined by evaluating the pleasure it causes. Hedonistics such as Sidwick claim that one should not strive to be happy. However, people should do other things whose success can trigger happiness in them. Conversely, eudemonistic utilitarianism, John Stuart Mill asserts that it is more preferable for human beings to be dissatisfied rather than feigning contentment. Eudemonistics equate good to the happiness it causes. On the other hand, ideal utilitarianism holds that human goods such as relationships and knowledge are of greater significance than pleasure. Notably, as Birsch confirms, utilitarians commonly agree that an action is perceived to be good if it helps in accomplishing people’s aspirations or needs7.Another point of conflict among the utilitarians lies in their definition of utility. This conflict has led to the development of three fractions, namely act utilitarians, rule utilitarianism, and general utilitarianism. Act utilitarians reason that an act is only good if its utility is greater than the available options. Similarly, Jeremy Bentham observes that when determining the moral standard of an act, one should not consider the entire world but rather the affected individuals. In the case of rule utilitarianism, the argument is that utility doctrine should not be viewed from an individual action but instead a collection of actions. Most utilitarians subscribe to the latter thought. Furthermore, according to Birsch, general utilitarians assert that people should consider the outcome if everybody chooses to imitate their actions8. As Birsch confirms, to counter these reservations, utilitarian scholars have claimed that ethics is created for man, not man for ethics.Ethical EgoismThis consequentialist approach holds that people should invest in ideas that result to the greatest good for themselves. It is generally divided into four categories, namely mental egoism where people have no option other than being self-seeking, personal egoism that states that a person has the choice to be self-centered, and personal ethical egoism where a person seeks to ensure that other people serve his or her personal interest. Differences may emerge concerning what ‘a good conduct’ entails. However, an excellent behavior is expected to attract excellence, authority, self-identity, and pleasure. Some of the ancient thinkers who played a major in the development of this ethical theory include Plato and Aristotle. However, according to Shafer-Landau, it was perfected by the likes of Cicero and Thomas Hobbes9.Ethical egoism has been a reservation because it causes a scenario that is against the moral principles. Hence, it implies that one should not consider the interest of the society. In the case of career choice, the ethical egoists find it logical to do something that brings no benefit to the society but to oneself. If ethical egoists endorse this idea, it will then be misleading because socio-biological scholars have observed that man is not self-seeking. People become happier when they satisfy the needs of others in the society. Furthermore, ethical egoism cannot also operate in a public forum because it is impractical where everyone is self-centered. Nonetheless, as Ciulla confirms, in post-modernistic society where people are deemed answerable to the society, ethical egoism remains relevant10.Traditional scholars have often subscribed to the thought that people should pick careers that promote charity. Observers have noted that individuals who chose to work in charitable organization can easily be replaced. Hence, it is preferable for them to be solely professional philanthropists. Consequentialist theorists confirm that the action can only be considered good or bad by analyzing the resulting pleasure. An individual has an opportunity to choose what can lead to either pleasure or pain. With this notion in mind, people should choose whatever leads to the highest pleasure. Hence, according to consequentialists, when one is choosing a career, he or she should evaluate what it may result in at the end. One should choose a career that will result in the greatest happiness. In essence, it is more preferable to become a humanitarian, rather than working in a charity organization because the former has the best gain. However, according to Birsch, if many people opt to become philanthropists, the society might become deficient of charity workers11.Deontological Ethics and Career ChoiceThis approach focuses on action. It departs from the idea of comparing an action with the results that it brings. According to deontological thinkers, a conduct is termed as good or evil not based on its results but rather based on its attributes. This nature of reasoning is borrowed from Judeo-Christian and Greek Stoic culture. The attributes include respect to human rights. Thus, an action that contradicts human rights will be deemed wrong. However, according to Ciulla, difficulties will arise in terms of applying this principle where one has to balance contradicting rights12.Under act deontologism, deontologists have developed two approaches that people demonstrate when making decisions. They include intuitionist and decisionist techniques. Intuitionist approach involves using one conscience when deciding whether a conduct is right or evil. On the other hand, under decisionist approach, no action is termed right. Rule deontologism orates that people should act according to particular set moral principles. These principles may be pluralistic or monistic in nature. W. D. Ross enlisted some of those moral principles that people should adhere to when making decisions. They include individual growth, devotion, openhandedness, righteousness, promise keeping, and non-malfeasance as Shafer-Landau observes13.Immanuel Kant, a rule deontologist, argues against consequentialist theory stating that it transforms morality into theoretical imperatives instead of unconditional ones. His philosophy is in tandem with the Ten Commandments. His rules of ethics consider morality a constant and universal element that comes before the performance of an act. They should develop out of experience. Man has no option but to adhere to the rules of morality. He or she has the obligation to do so. An action can be considered moral if it passes the three tests. Furthermore, Kant emphasizes the need to treat other individuals as rational beings. People should view everyone as ends, rather than a means of getting to the end. As rational beings, human beings should be in a position to create universal rules without necessarily depending on external powers such as God or traditions as Birsch confirms14.Another concept under deontologist approach is ethical relativism. This concept holds that where two cultures clash on ethical issues, both of them can be correct because different societies are divergent in nature and/or are driven by disparate principles. The concept denounces the existence of universal principles. Besides, it encourages people to tolerate the moral beliefs of others. Some ethical relativists subscribe to the subjective thought that principles are personal and that other members of the society should tolerate what one considers moral. Ethical relativism is growing in terms of popularity where many scholars assert that every society’s moral standards should be evaluated using its own principles. Nonetheless, it has also received reservations because it becomes difficult to compare one person to another upon making morals subjective. It promotes individuality, thus making judgment of the accepted social morals difficult. According to Birsch, it encourages civil disobedience.AgapismAlso known the ethics of love, this deontological approach asserts that the sole ethical code is love, specifically the love of human beings and the creator. The remaining principles are attached to the latter code. Although scholars claim that agapism should be categorized under deontological approach. Ciulla says that other scholars view it as substitute for all moral concepts15. Moral ethical theories should help professionals in making decisions such that they do not harm the consumers of their services. Similarly, when choosing a career, one should consider the ethical stands of the deontological thinkers. One cannot join a crime simply because he or she is going to have the greatest benefit from that particular occupation. It should bring honor to the pursuer as well as the society as a whole. Nonetheless, some individuals still love to choose a career that brings the highest profit to the society without considering the means as long as they believe that the end will be positive. Furthermore, since human beings are naturally egoistic, they will pursue careers that benefit them. However, a question can be raised, ‘is the move a moral decision?’ Despite the various theories that can guide one in making an ethical career choice, this subsequent section will explain how one can settle on a particular career using the natural law ethics.Making a Career Choice using Natural Law TheoryAccording to Chan, Fung, and Yau, natural law theory as propounded by ancient thinkers such as Aquinas asserts that natural is provided by a supreme being and is controls humankind16. Right actions are only those actions that in line with ‘the good’. Aquinas the manner in which one can know when he/she is making the right decision. One of those methods is through using virtue ethics approach. According to virtue ethics, an ethical life is that which is upright. Contrary to most ethical theories, it encourages people to be upright instead of establishing codes for evaluating the most ethical behaviors. For instance, if one picks a right action, he or she should anticipate that it might lead to a positive result. Therefore, if one decides to become a humanitarian in order to assist some poor families in Africa, he or she should not do it because it is the right choice but because of the anticipated good outcome. The fact that philanthropy is a right act to do should be the primary reason for one’s action while the outcomes remain secondary. Even if a right action fails, it will still be said that one did the right thing. Moreover, one might expect that the right thing will benefit the society and his or her personality as Ciulla observes17.People should be in a position to evaluate and recognize what inspires them to a given action. Moreover, they should know the circumstances under which there might be an ethical dilemma if they act, and hence make an incorrect decision. Considering a scenario where one decides to become a humanitarian following the advice of people who tell him or her that it does not profit his or her community, the person is bound to receive adoration from the community. This situation implies that the individual will become philanthropic because he or she seeks to be praised by the society. In such a scenario, he or she is benevolent not because it is the right thing to do but because it leads to positive results as Ugwuoke asserts18.One may claim that being philanthropic with the latter’s mindset does not alter the moral nature of humanitarian actions. However, in comparison with a humanitarian who decides to become generous out of selflessness, the benevolent person will be given a higher ethical standard than the former. Moreover, an individual who becomes a humanitarian simply because he or she seeks to get adoration from the society will be far much less than a charity worker who does his or her work altruistically. The case of self-centered philanthropist and altruistic charity workers objects the argument posed by consequentialists who venerate the need to cause happiness to the highest number of people. The application of the natural law theory seems to answer the question of whose action seems closest to an ethical good.Evaluation of any intentions prior to performing an act or choosing an occupation will assist in picking the career with the ethical value. A person should always pick career that is contrary to the negative ethical inclination. It has to be in line with the positive moral attributes. The reason behind this claim is not simply that choosing negative moral ideas will cause bad ethical results, but that bad ethical ideas will contaminate one’s moral status. As Ugwuoke asserts, it is contrary to the right thing and thus will eventually have a negative effect to the society19.Consider a situation where John wants to select between a charity worker and a humanitarian. Consider also that he has a negative ethical tendency of selfishness. John desires to be a philanthropist since it will enable him to benefit the society whilst gaining a status that he cannot get if he were just employed in a charity organization. Nonetheless, by being a charity worker, John knows that he will be more efficient, although he remains being a humanitarian because of his egoistic tendencies. If John goes against his most compelling negative moral attribute (selfishness ) to follows his most convincing positive ethical inclination (charity worker), he will have made a choice with the highest ethical standard. Making the right decision, as evidenced in this scenario, brings benefits to the community whilst also elevating an individual’s moral character as noted by Chan, Fung, and Yau20. This approach departs from the consequentialist thinking and ethical relativism whereby different people can make disparate decisions in a similar situation. Indeed, since people are bound to have different careers, it is expected that they will make different decisions that are in line with their personality. However, the process of making choices as presented in the natural law theory should remain constant.The Issue of Integrity and Human DignityPeople often choose actions based on charity work or integrity. As discussed above, charity emerges when people consider how their career is going to affect the society. When career involves looking at the pursuer, issues of integrity come in. Consider this example of Peter who is a respected biochemist. He is invited by the state to help in the manufacture of chemical weapons. He is promised heavy returns once he accepts the job within a given timeline. Otherwise, the job will be given to someone else who is less qualified. Peter dislikes the idea because production of chemical weapons is against his moral principles. He refuses to take the job. Although accepting the job might have benefitted the country, that is, the greatest number of people as projected by consequentialist theorists, refusing remains the most ethical decision in such a situation. Making a decision against his moral standards in an attempt to please people might tamper with his integrity. Furthermore, if Peter does the job against his personal desires, he will become ineffective, and thus interfere with the quality of production of the chemical weapons as Birsch reveals21.Another issue pertains to human dignity. Using some theories can rank some careers lower than others, irrespective of the commitment of the pursuer. Consequentialist approach considers a philanthropic occupation more important than that of a charity worker. Irrespective of the commitment and selflessness of the charity worker, a self-seeking philanthropist will be viewed as an individual who has a higher moral standard relative to the charity worker. In fact, utilitarian scholars claim that any action that brings the most good in the society is the most ethical. A question might be raised on how this evaluation will be done. Empirically, the level of professional humanitarian will be calculated with respect to the amount of money that a person gives to the society. This situation implies that the higher the amount contributed to the society, the higher a philanthropist’s moral status. This mode of quantifying moral duties is unjust, in this case, to a selfless charity worker. Thus, the consequentialist approach reduces the dignity and morality of the pursuant, a situation that must be discouraged as Ciulla advises22.According to Chan, Fung, and Yau, the natural law theory is also not immune to weaknesses with respect to its application23. The approach seems to have several assumptions. However, no definite description of moral good has been established, although certain universal ethical principles are evident. Hence, the intentions of an individual should be in line with the accepted universal ethical codes. People are naturally dissimilar. However, the moral good is constant in every person. Hence, whenever people seek to make a career choice, their decision should oppose the most convincing negative moral attributes, irrespective of the occupation. However, as Birsch asserts, the choice must support the most convincing and constructive ethical behavior24.ConclusionCareer choice is among the key decisions that an individual makes in his or her lifetime. Such decisions affect the rest of one’s life. They have the power to influence people’s mannerism. Making an ethical career choice is important because it enables one to choose a career that not only benefits the society but also the individual. Several theories that are mainly divided into consequentialist and deontologist approaches help in explaining the career choice that can result in the highest moral status. Consequentialists justify the applied means if the end is positive. Furthermore, the theory encourages people to engage in careers that bring the greatest benefit to highest number of people. Conversely, deontologists hold that a moral means must be used in doing a particular task. The fact that the outcome is positive does not justify the means. Having examined the various ethical theories, this paper has preferred the natural law theory as the best approach for choosing a career. Under this concept, one should do the right thing because he or she is convinced that the act is the correct thing to do for him or her to appreciate the results later. Essentially, when choosing a career, one should ignore his or her convincing poor moral motives and focus on the most persuasive positive moral character.BibliographyBirsch, Douglas.

999f89ee,0,"#Learning a New Language: Importance for Career Development  Learning a foreign language can be a significant driver towards getting better job opportunities. Remarkably, 35% of the people responsible for hiring stated that multilingual employees make human resource managers extend a job offer, grant interviews, recommend promotion, and increase remuneration (Hulett). Many organizations are increasingly seeking bilingual workers, as evidenced in the statistics showing that in 2010 there were 240,000 job postings for such individuals compared to 630,000 in 2015 (“Demand for Bilingual”). Fluency in other languages such as Arabic, Chinese, French, and Spanish increases the personal brand both locally and internationally. Globalization has further made people need to work in a multicultural setting. Language can be a bridge for learning and understanding individual differences to foster a positive environment. Although learning a new language can be hectic for adults, it has advantages such as widening opportunities, higher salaries, intercultural understanding, and cognitive advancement.People with multilingual capabilities have global competencies such that their job search is not limited to their country of origin. Organizations may view such employees as assets because they can serve as in-house translators for transactions and meetings (Hulett). The implication is that there are more job offers that a person can choose. Furthermore, even when a person loses one job, they have a higher chance of getting employed within the shortest time due to having skills. The implication is that they have a higher competitive advantage in the market (Williams). Therefore, people who understand multiple languages will likely have job security and steady career growth.Moreover, there are organizations that are looking for people whose primary role is to translate relevant information to the company. The implication is that even if a person does not have a degree but they understand multiple languages it is easier for them to get a career. Better still, there are several lucrative entrepreneur opportunities that bilingual people can venture in successfully. For example, a person can decide to be a local tour guides of international visitors who do not understand English. In addition, working as a freelance interpreter as a part time job is possible for people who are multilingual. The opportunities for self-employment and a flexible work environment are many for translators in the contemporary world.Firms are always willing to bid for more if they perceive that the deal they will get has a higher value. The ability to speak a language that is in demand, such as Chinese, can result in a salary increase or promotion (Hulett). A person can have higher bargaining power because other companies need their skill. Therefore, the more multinational languages a person can learn and speak, the higher their worth to companies because they make communication easy. The implication is that they get promotions to work in senior positions because of their ability to speak multiple languages. In addition, they may be eligible for more oversees travels and meetings which gives them an opportunity to get bonuses and allowances. Thus, even when they are in the same job groups as others, their chances of getting extra money is higher.Bilingual people are an asset to organizations because they can enhance intercultural relations and establish rapport with potential clients and partners. Research shows that learning a new language fosters awareness of the values, traditions, and vices of the people of interest (Kroll and Paul). Notably, language expressions help interpret aspects relevant to people. When a company sells to clients from a different country, and they are received by someone who speaks their language, they feel necessary (Hulett). The implication is that they become loyal members because they feel appreciated. Similarly, such an employee may enhance partnerships during internationalization. The benefit for the worker is that it is possible to meet many people and create a network with professionals that can help in other entrepreneurial ventures.People with more language competencies have advanced cognitive skills, which increases creativity and problem-solving capabilities. Learning new words and sentence construction requires a person to analogously use creative thoughts. They can use the same process whenever the company is in a crisis to bring ideas for resolving issues. Moreover, multilingualism transforms the mind to create resilience even in stressful environments (Kroll and Paola 254). Such an advanced brain enables the employee to develop innovative solutions. Moreover, learning a new language causes a person to develop new neural pathways and connections (Hulett). Multilingual individuals have advanced code-switching. The capabilities can easily be applied in other businesses, such as product development. Thus, these employees have multitasking capabilities and think strategically.In conclusion, learning a new language has many advantages to a person’s career growth as it enhances their competitiveness in the local and international market. Such workers have higher bargaining power for better salaries and promotions. Moreover, they have multicultural competencies that allow them to form professional networks, which can help when they start a business. Bilingualism promotes brain neural development and structure that increases problem-solving skills. Therefore, students who wish to enhance their career goals should consider learning a new multinational language.Works Cited“Demand for Bilingual Workers More Than Doubled in 5 Years, New Report Shows.” New American Economy, Web.Hulett, Matt. “How The Power of Language Can Grow Your Career and Business.” Forbes, Web.Kroll, Judith F., and Paola E.

They attempt to illuminate the interrelationship of individual personality and behavior with work and careers. However, some prevailing career development theories were based solely on research on white males from middle- and upper-middle-class backgrounds, so their applicability to women, people of color, and other socioeconomic groups has been called into question. In addition, the focus on individual psychological or personality characteristics does not take into account the wider environmental context in which people make career decisions, thus failing to recognize the constraints faced by some groups. This Digest investigates broader perspectives on career development that are being built on emerging research focused on gender, race, ethnicity, and social class. The implications of this information for career and vocational educators and counselors are discussed.Issues Related to Career Development TheoriesSome types of career development theories include trait and factor, life-span, and social cognitive (Sharf 1997). This section looks at some of the issues surrounding the applicability of these theories in regard to gender, race, and class.Trait and Factor Theories. The basis of trait and factor theories is the assumption that there are unique traits that can be reliably measured and that it is possible to match individual traits to occupational requirements. Holland identified six types of occupations theorized that people seek work environments and occupations that match their preferred traits. However, some people question the accuracy of the instruments used to measure...... middle of paper ......h: What Kind and by Whom? ERIC Digest.

59f9be19,0,"#The Importance of National Career Development Guidelines  The Importance of National Career Development GuidelinesI will discuss the National Career Development Guidelines and will address each section of the guidelines in terms of its importance in career counseling.  As well, I will critique an activity that is used in elementary school setting against the guidelines to compare if the activity meets the standards.Section one; of the National Career Development guidelines address matters of personal social development.  In this domain interpersonal skills are addressed, work-life balance is addressed, and interpersonal growth and development are assessed.  In terms of specific interventions I would help clients look at their current situation.  I would coin this as kind of a “self-inventory checklist” intervention.  Does the client have a realistic idea of the necessary skills to get into their desired career choice? Are they looking at the compatibility of personal and family needs?  Does their personality match their desired career field?  I would use this guideline very much as a much of a precursor to the miracle question intervention.  I would have the clients really look at themselves and their situation before they start creating goals.  I would in the domain use some standardized testing to get a base of their career readiness and interests.The second domain is the Educational Achievement and Life Long Learning domain.  This area of the guidelines deals with experience, education, performance, and adaptability.  If this section I would focus my interventions more on assessing the client’s desired future and what is needed to achieve that end result.  I would use the assessments, inventories, and goals that the client described and start tapping on their strength and exceptions to start developing a career plan.

The activity address the personal demands and commitment of the career, what is needed, in terms of education and development to obtain that position, and it address the long terms implications of what is needed of the career and it’s impact on the community.  Coupling this activity with a personal journal it will give the students to ability to apply the action steps of the domains so they can have a realistic idea of the their desired career path.

5d42dc04,0,"#My Ideal Career Choice: ,  GradesFixerMy name is Vishnu Nair and I am currently in 9th grade attending Harmony Science Academy Houston. I am currently taking a PLTW Introduction to Engineering course to see if engineering could be a future career pathway for me. I am very interested in computer engineering along with computer science as I truly have a passion and love for technology. Deciding on what career to pursue is a very hard decision to make as you might not know what you like. Everyone is afraid to spend a lot of hard work and time to get a job that they don’t like. Therefore, your career choice is possibly the most important decision in your adult life. Personally, I have chosen to set my sights on a career in the technology field as I have always loved technology and have been working with it ever since I was a kid. For now, I have decided to study to become a computer scientist as I like coding things and finding ways on how to make things function properly while still using technology. After taking the Clifton strengths assignment I found that my top 5 strengths were: focus, restorative, strategic, achiever, and responsibility. My most dominant trait was focus meaning I can take a direction or make a choice and follow through with it until I am done completely. This can be very useful as a computer scientist as there are many tasks to do in the job and you need to focus completely on one project at a time to get things done efficiently. My other strengths like restorative, strategic, and achiever can come in handy as these strengths make it easier for you to overcome challenges and problems. As a computer scientist, you are faced with many issues, so these 3 strengths are crucial. Lastly, my strength of responsibility will come in handy as you need to own up to your mistakes you might make as a computer scientist. You need to be able to take the blame and improve your skills.Say no to plagiarism. Get a tailor-made essay on'Why Violent Video Games Shouldn't Be Banned'?Get original essaySince my ideal job is a computer and information scientist, I will need to obtain a computer science degree in college which usually takes 2 years as a full-time student or 3 to 4 years as a part-time student. Computer scientists do many tasks like exploring fundamental issues in computing and developing theories and models to address those issues. As a computer scientist, I would also, invent new computing languages, tools, and methods to improve the way in which people work with computers. The median annual wage of a computer and information scientist is $118,370 and the most skilled ones can make around $176,780. For the job outlook of becoming a computer and information scientist, the industry is rapidly growing projected to increase by 16% from 2018 to 2028 which is very high compared to other occupations. As people want better technologies, companies would have to hire more computer scientists which can heavily increase my chances of getting hired in the future. Furthermore, obtaining a degree in computer science is a safe bet as the whole computer industry is growing and since computer scientists are in higher demand than ever before.I currently reside in the Houston area in which there are 22 annual job openings for a computer and information research scientist alone. This is a very high number and is projected to grow exponentially in the future. The starting salary when you get the job is already $62,381. However, you can make up to $203,198 in the Houston area if you’re very talented. Daily tasks include designing computers and the software that runs them and participating in multidisciplinary projects in areas such as virtual reality, human-computer interaction, or robotics. As a computer scientist, you need to know how to code certain things using Python or Java or other programs. Also, in the Houston area, most of the Computer and Information Research scientists have some form of college background either a bachelors, masters, or doctorate degree. Furthermore, this job has been on the rise in the Houston area with 1,832 jobs popping up from October 2016 to the current-day.According to the Texas Reality Check assessment, I would need an annual salary of $119,194 to live my lavish lifestyle. My future job would be perfectly fine as the median Computer and Information Research Scientist gets $129,000 in the Houston area meaning I will still have some money left over even after having a rather expensive lifestyle. The lifestyle I intend to live would be rather expensive as I want: a luxury vehicle, house, pets, 2 children, luxurious clothes, leather furniture, have adequate dental and healthcare, go on movies, and still go on vacations with friends and family. This would be a very expensive lifestyle but luckily my job will be able to pay for it. Additionally, with my estimated $10,000 of excess money I would invest most of the money into stocks like Apple or Tesla as I know these companies will continuously grow. I would also donate $1,000 every year to my local charity to help give back and help the poor. If I still have excess money from this, I will spend some money on a YouTube channel so I can inspire people and maybe become an influencer.My career as a Computer and Information Research Scientist wouldn’t prefer me to live in a certain area as most work is done digitally through a computer. However, it might help as most large technology companies are based in California which might make me move to Los Angeles. If I decided to move to Los Angeles, my cost of living would significantly increase as many things there are much more expensive. Groceries would be 30% more, housing would be 160% more, transportation would be 30% more, and healthcare would be 21% more. Housing would be the most significant factor as housing in Los Angeles is 160% more than in Houston which would drive my main expense up by a lot! I would need to make a salary of $200,147 to live in California as comfortable as I would live in Houston which I find rather absurd. However, the average salary in California is higher compared to that of Houston which somewhat makes up for the immense price increase. Another city I would think about living in is New York City as it is home to many very large technology companies. However, moving to New York City would be very expensive. Groceries would be 44% more, housing would be 283% more, utilities 7% more, transportation 11% more, and lastly health care which would be 16% more! The most noticeable price increase would be housing as it is around 3 times more than Houston! Thankfully people in New York get paid higher on average then Houstonians which can help in paying the immense amount of money needed to live in Brooklyn compared to Houston. Living in these two cities might cost more than Houston but these cities have much more job opportunities and provide a higher chance of getting into a more well-known company and business.While studying for becoming a Computer and Information Research Scientist, I can volunteer at some organizations to show my future employers that I am truly caring about the community. Also volunteering and doing these things can potentially help me get some experience under my belt. One place I can possibly volunteer at is the United Way of Greater Houston. For this, I will need to teach people how to do small coding along with teaching them how to use the Adobe Creative Suite software. During volunteering, I can potentially meet other Computer and Information Research Scientists who are trying to help out in the community helping me make connections. These connections can potentially land me a job with a company or help start a valuable friendship. To continue, another place I would volunteer at is the RSVP of Southeast Texas. During volunteering, I would have to help maintain and add information to a website that is for a disability awareness non-profit. While doing this I might meet website developers and I can get insight into how they do things differently compared to my future job. Additionally, these website developers also might have a computer science degree so maybe we could study together, or they can give me a few tips! I think volunteering would be a good idea as it helps the community while still giving me experience for my future job.Keep in mind:  This is only a sample.Get a custom paper now from our expert writers.Get custom essayMy long-term goal is specifically to become an accomplished and successful Computer and Information Research Scientist. I plan to do this in around 8 years as I am only in 9th grade and need 4 more years of high school and at least 2 years of college to get my degree and job. In order to do this, I will take notes in all my classes to make sure I sustain all the information I learned. I will also go to as much volunteering as needed until I am comfortable with my future tasks to make sure I get a good job and do my job well. Lastly, I will study very hard and get good grades so that I can go to a prestigious university such as Rice University and study well while making connections in the industry. After getting out of university I hope to get a job at Microsoft as it has been my dream job to work there since I was a kid. An obstacle that might get in my way is depression as obtaining a computer science degree can be very tedious and takes a lot of hard work. However, I plan to persevere throughout the hard times and study to make it big later in life. After reaching this goal, I imagine myself to be a happy person living a lavish life, becoming married soon, and having kids and inspiring them to work hard in life while doing good for the world.

Computer scientists do many tasks like exploring fundamental issues in computing and developing theories and models to address those issues. As a computer scientist, I would also, invent new computing languages, tools, and methods to improve the way in which people work with computers. The median annual wage of a computer and information scientist is $118,370 and the most skilled ones can make around $176,780. For the job outlook of becoming a computer and information scientist, the industry is rapidly growing projected to increase by 16% from 2018 to 2028 which is very high compared to other occupations. As people want better technologies, companies would have to hire more computer scientists which can heavily increase my chances of getting hired in the future. Furthermore, obtaining a degree in computer science is a safe bet as the whole computer industry is growing and since computer scientists are in higher demand than ever before.I currently reside in the Houston area in which there are 22 annual job openings for a computer and information research scientist alone. This is a very high number and is projected to grow exponentially in the future. The starting salary when you get the job is already $62,381. However, you can make up to $203,198 in the Houston area if you’re very talented. Daily tasks include designing computers and the software that runs them and participating in multidisciplinary projects in areas such as virtual reality, human-computer interaction, or robotics. As a computer scientist, you need to know how to code certain things using Python or Java or other programs. Also, in the Houston area, most of the Computer and Information Research scientists have some form of college background either a bachelors, masters, or doctorate degree. Furthermore, this job has been on the rise in the Houston area with 1,832 jobs popping up from October 2016 to the current-day.According to the Texas Reality Check assessment, I would need an annual salary of $119,194 to live my lavish lifestyle. My future job would be perfectly fine as the median Computer and Information Research Scientist gets $129,000 in the Houston area meaning I will still have some money left over even after having a rather expensive lifestyle. The lifestyle I intend to live would be rather expensive as I want: a luxury vehicle, house, pets, 2 children, luxurious clothes, leather furniture, have adequate dental and healthcare, go on movies, and still go on vacations with friends and family. This would be a very expensive lifestyle but luckily my job will be able to pay for it. Additionally, with my estimated $10,000 of excess money I would invest most of the money into stocks like Apple or Tesla as I know these companies will continuously grow. I would also donate $1,000 every year to my local charity to help give back and help the poor. If I still have excess money from this, I will spend some money on a YouTube channel so I can inspire people and maybe become an influencer.My career as a Computer and Information Research Scientist wouldn’t prefer me to live in a certain area as most work is done digitally through a computer. However, it might help as most large technology companies are based in California which might make me move to Los Angeles. If I decided to move to Los Angeles, my cost of living would significantly increase as many things there are much more expensive. Groceries would be 30% more, housing would be 160% more, transportation would be 30% more, and healthcare would be 21% more. Housing would be the most significant factor as housing in Los Angeles is 160% more than in Houston which would drive my main expense up by a lot! I would need to make a salary of $200,147 to live in California as comfortable as I would live in Houston which I find rather absurd. However, the average salary in California is higher compared to that of Houston which somewhat makes up for the immense price increase. Another city I would think about living in is New York City as it is home to many very large technology companies. However, moving to New York City would be very expensive. Groceries would be 44% more, housing would be 283% more, utilities 7% more, transportation 11% more, and lastly health care which would be 16% more! The most noticeable price increase would be housing as it is around 3 times more than Houston! Thankfully people in New York get paid higher on average then Houstonians which can help in paying the immense amount of money needed to live in Brooklyn compared to Houston. Living in these two cities might cost more than Houston but these cities have much more job opportunities and provide a higher chance of getting into a more well-known company and business.While studying for becoming a Computer and Information Research Scientist, I can volunteer at some organizations to show my future employers that I am truly caring about the community. Also volunteering and doing these things can potentially help me get some experience under my belt. One place I can possibly volunteer at is the United Way of Greater Houston. For this, I will need to teach people how to do small coding along with teaching them how to use the Adobe Creative Suite software. During volunteering, I can potentially meet other Computer and Information Research Scientists who are trying to help out in the community helping me make connections. These connections can potentially land me a job with a company or help start a valuable friendship. To continue, another place I would volunteer at is the RSVP of Southeast Texas. During volunteering, I would have to help maintain and add information to a website that is for a disability awareness non-profit. While doing this I might meet website developers and I can get insight into how they do things differently compared to my future job. Additionally, these website developers also might have a computer science degree so maybe we could study together, or they can give me a few tips! I think volunteering would be a good idea as it helps the community while still giving me experience for my future job.Keep in mind:  This is only a sample.Get a custom paper now from our expert writers.Get custom essayMy long-term goal is specifically to become an accomplished and successful Computer and Information Research Scientist. I plan to do this in around 8 years as I am only in 9th grade and need 4 more years of high school and at least 2 years of college to get my degree and job. In order to do this, I will take notes in all my classes to make sure I sustain all the information I learned. I will also go to as much volunteering as needed until I am comfortable with my future tasks to make sure I get a good job and do my job well. Lastly, I will study very hard and get good grades so that I can go to a prestigious university such as Rice University and study well while making connections in the industry. After getting out of university I hope to get a job at Microsoft as it has been my dream job to work there since I was a kid. An obstacle that might get in my way is depression as obtaining a computer science degree can be very tedious and takes a lot of hard work. However, I plan to persevere throughout the hard times and study to make it big later in life. After reaching this goal, I imagine myself to be a happy person living a lavish life, becoming married soon, and having kids and inspiring them to work hard in life while doing good for the world.

To study in this field, I had to overcome hurdles, a common entrance examination, which I had to take along with hundreds of thousands of students, all aspiring to get through. I passed with flying colors, being placed in the top X% of all students who took the examination. I took up Mechanical Engineering in XXXXX COLLEGE affiliated to prestigious XXX University as my undergraduate major because it has tremendous potential to become a dominant force in this millennium, affecting all walks of human life. I have maintained a clean and brilliant academic record throughout my years in this course.The undergraduate study has given me a comprehensive exposure to a wide spectrum of courses, namely, Design Engineering, Kinematics of Machinery, Engineering Graphics, Finite Element Analysis, Thermodynamics, Mechanics of Solids, Robotics, Computer aided Design/Computer aided Manufacturing, etc. I strongly believe in “learning by doing”.

fc58f576,0,"#Career Planning: Arguments To Avoid  Among the reasons that students list for going to college having a good job and earning a lot of money are the most common. In that regard, the value of knowledge as a life application is not so significant if such knowledge does not have a monetary equivalent. Thus, career planning is an important step that should be approached with due care, avoiding the common mistakes that can be made during such a process. This article will attempt to briefly cover a few of such mistakes.The WagesConsidering the highest paid jobs is a logical decision in career planning, which often can be justified. People look at various ratings that indicate the “hot” job positions and make their career and educational choices based on such a decision. Well, such a factor is not a mistake in common sense, rather than being a very limited approach that ignores other aspects. One example of such factors is students’ skills and abilities, where students considering such choice might end up always falling behind. The high salaries paid to such positions are not based solely on students’ majors, rather than on their excellence in such fields.The InterestPlanning a career in a subject that not only a person will be good at, but also will provide a particular interest is also an essential element. Part of the success in a career is to love the thing you do, and in that sense, sometimes people overestimate the importance of such a factor. It should be noted that despite that many people can change their career path, many of them do not. For those who do not enjoy mediocre success early in their career, improving or keeping up at the same level becomes harder and harder with age. Thus, the point is to plan a career as if it will be the only job throughout the lifetime, while at the same time having a plan B."
5cc22ce4,0,"#Career Development in Generation X -    Career Development in Generation XCareer Development in Generation XGeneration X refers to the population cohort following the Baby Boomers. Sources differ as to the exact years during which this cohort was born. Coupland (1991) suggests 1960 to 1970; Bradford and Raines (1992) propose 1965 to 1975; and Howe and Strauss (1993) suggest 1961 to 1981. Whatever the birth years, it is their common life experiences that give this cohort an identity. Individuals born in Generation X are reputedly more global, technologically oriented, and culturally diverse than the generations before them. Coming of age when the linear career path no longer exists, where average income is falling, and where continuous change is the norm, does this generation have different values, work ethics, and attitudes toward work and career development? As the myths and realities of this question are explored, it is important to remember that the characteristics, habits, and traits attributed to individuals in this cohort are mere generalizations, presented to afford a better understanding of the generation called Generation X.Myth: Individuals in Generation X Are Slackers,Lacking Career Drive and AmbitionVarious books, articles, and surveys have described individuals in Generation X as slackers, cynical about the future and resentful of Baby Boomers who have ""taken all the good jobs"" (Kruger 1994). This description is based on observations that Generation X workers jump from job to job, are unwilling to conform to organizational demands that do not suit them, and leave jobs that bore them and are not ""fun"" (Wyld 1994).

d8ddd57d,0,"#Career Decision-Making in Business Administration  IntroductionIt is important to note that identifying key issues in one’s field of interest is critical in order to be able to effectively manage and resolve them. In business administration, one of the main challenges is knowing where to apply the acquired knowledge and skills. The two major problems include deciding where to use the associate’s degree and planning when I should start my own business.Starting Business After Graduation in Business AdministrationThe first primary issue is trying to decide what I want to do with my associate’s degree when I obtain it because there are many options. A study suggests that “students do not equally value or understand the purpose of the associate’s degree” (Cortes-Lopez & Taylor, 2020, p. 61). In other words, the abundance of options is as paralyzing as the lack of them. One arguable side is deciding on a standard path of becoming an administrative assistant mainly focused on operations. Another arguable side is to go into sales, such as sales supervisor and consultant, because it can be highly lucrative if one has the necessary skills.The second major issue is deciding when to start my own business. All people studying and working in the business administration field tend to have plan to start their own businesses at some point in their careers (Boone et al., 2019). However, this requires deliberate planning ahead in the longer term since the relevant experience needs to be accumulated and funds secured. One arguable side is to do it within five years after graduation because I have the resources needed, and the failure experience will be valuable for my career. The other arguable side is postponing it and focusing solely on a career to accumulate as much experience and knowledge as possible.When it comes to deciding the future career option used for my associate’s degree, my decision lies with administrative responsibilities and operations management. The first reason for such a choice is a mere self-awareness of my strengths and weaknesses as an individual. I have a more analytical mind and operate well under conditions of precision and accuracy. Secondly, sales require a masterful ability to interact with customers, which mandates the presence of human skills, such as being an effective communicator. Therefore, opting for administrative positions might have a better use for my skills and knowledge and my limited experience. However, it is critical to be flexible and adaptable to new pursuits, which is why I am not fully rejecting the alternative. I do not know whether I would enjoy sales since I did not work in the field. Thus, realistically I will go for administrative career paths but will be open to new opportunities offered by my associate’s degree.ConclusionIn conclusion, I decided to postpone starting my own business even if I am fortunate enough to have access to the resource to start the business with some degree of safety. The decision is based on a lack of experience and competence. It would be better to acquire the latter needs in a safe and reliable environment of employment. The availability of an opportunity does not necessarily mandate reckless use of it. Therefore, I will focus on growing and developing my career of choice. My topic is important and meaningful because it showcases the criticality of long-term planning and self-awareness of one’s limitations and strengths."
878f041c,0,"#What Are the Career Doldrums? -    What Are the Career Doldrums?What Are the Career Doldrums?The notion of the career doldrums is not a new one. Individuals have suffered from the symptoms associated with this concept for as long as jobs and careers have existed. What is new is the more open acknowledgment of the phenomenon. Judith Waterman, a career counselor in San Mateo, California, has seen her client base change significantly during the last 20 years. After beginning with reentry women in the 1970s, Waterman reports that ""during the 1980s, [she] was seeing high achievers who were thinking, 'How did I get here and why am I not happy?' but they were keeping it under wraps."" By the mid-1990s, however, she reports that it had become more acceptable to admit career dissatisfaction (Hornaday 1995, online).Betsy Collard, another career specialist, believes that part of this trend is related to ""how personally knowledge workers view their work and the meaning of it,"" but that it is also related to changes in the economy. ""In times of change, everybody turns inward to get clear about what's important to them, who they are, and what they want out of this"" (ibid.).The career doldrums may also be associated with certain career stages. Careers are like lives in that they go through stages that frequently include transitions into new phases. One framework (Nicholson cited in Kidd 1998) for analyzing work transitions includes the following stages:.   The preparation stage that occurs prior to assuming a work role..   The encounter stage that covers the early days of a career experience in whichindividuals begin to make sense of the chosen career. This stage may include shock,rejection, and regret..   The adjustment stage that involves the period in which individuals learn to do theirwork and make the adjustments necessary to reduce any dissonance between careerchoice and personal traits..   The stabilization stage in which job performance is the main focus. In this stage,failure, boredom, and stagnation are not uncommon.The symptoms associated with the career doldrums are most closely aligned with the stabilization stage. Individuals are not likely to become bored with or dissatisfied with their careers until they have had an opportunity to experience them for a while. Individuals who are in careers that are not a good fit may begin experiencing symptoms in the adjustment stage as they accommodate their careers to their personal traits and aptitudes.Explains the encounter stage that covers the early days of a career experience.Explains the adjustment stage that involves the period in which individuals learn to do their job.Explains the encounter stage that covers the early days of a career experience.Explains the adjustment stage that involves the period in which individuals learn to do their job.Explains the stabilization stage in which job performance is the main focus.Explains that individual careers are multifaceted and no single solution can be applied to those periods of dissatisfaction and boredom.Explains that moving up might mean a change to another company or changing the work emphasis.Opines that downshifting may be a solution for someone who is ready to give greater priority to.Explains that making adaptations in a current career situation is also an option.Explains that many people cope with the career doldrums by finding fulfillment in interests outside of their jobs. the accountant who was suffering a career slump found that she had unused mechanical skills.Explains planned happenstance, a theory that helps individuals develop skills to recognize, create, and use chance in career opportunities.Opines that ""one size fits all"" is not the solution to addressing the career doldrums. hudson poses questions for surviving a midlife career plateau transition that are applicable to other situations when career satisfaction is low.Asks what needs to be done to sustain balance in life and pacing in schedule?Opines that responding to these questions may provide insights into the type of strategies that will be most helpful in curbing the career doldrums.Explains that the concept of career doldrums isn't new, but the more open acknowledgment of the phenomenon.Explains that the symptoms associated with career doldrums are most closely aligned with the stabilization stage.Explains that career counseling can help individuals who are stuck on a career doldrums.Explains that making a career move can be as simple as making changes within the same organization or as radical as shifting into another career field.Explains that a complete change of careers may be the only option because it may mean retraining as well as ""starting over.""Explains how career direction can be repackaged within the flow of new jobs and openings.Cites clarke, caroline v., grannon, and hornaday, ann.

7891a05a,0,"#Reflective Essay on Choosing Career Choice -  - EdubirdieThe role of Women in the digital world was one of the topics that was presented to us on the 11th of October, 2019 by our guest lecturer Paula Neary, a Managing Director within Accenture’s Health and Public Service practice in Ireland. Her extensive experience in leading the successful design and execution of large-scale, complex business and ICT transformation programs across the public service makes her a noteworthy and trusted individual in her field. She delivered a very moving lecture on the current situation of Women in the Technological Industry using various quantitative data and analyses backing up her every claim and notion which was divided into various sub-topics. The various gender imbalances when it came to the number of women pursuing careers in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) were also emphasized deeply by Paula during her presentation.Various points made by Paula really did open our eyes to the issues women face in technology and why we actually require women in the digital economy for example to fill in the STEM skills shortages, the advantage women have over men when it comes to multitasking, etc. This is where she brought up the influences and barriers regarding this issue and put up statistical information that showed how parents and teachers influenced the decision made by males and females in determining their future career choices and decisions; around 49% of females have their career aspirations influenced by their parents and about 58% of career choices in the STEM field have been dropped by children due to issues with their teachers. The argument of stereotypical perceptions also playing a major role in determining career choices is something that really does resonate with current trends in society. The perception that boys are more likely to be influenced by money and the viewpoint that men are more likely to move into the engineering and IT field due to the stereotypical mindset of parents backed by her statistical data shined a very bright light on what’s really happening in the modern world. Paula’s arguments and statistical data on stereotypes, gender imbalances, and lack of female role models in the field of Science and Technology do provide a real insight into the main topic at hand, but one can’t stop themselves from asking the question of what were the root causes of these various stereotypes, what historical and modern-day factors influenced such a trend and what along with the points highlighted by Paula caused this huge imbalance of the role of Women in Technology???After digging into the subject and doing some research myself, I was able to find out that the women in our society have been discriminated against legally, functionally, and structurally in different ways since the 1800s. Surprisingly ancient history records many strong female figures, rulers, and warriors who performed acts that the history writers thought worthy of recording. Names such as Cleopatra, Boudicca, and Esther echo down history to the present day. Even in the early Christian church, there is evidence that women could hold positions of influence equal to men. But all this changed throughout the centuries and even today women cannot be priests in the Catholic church which has followed on from these early traditions. It is only really in the twentieth century that women made any gains in equality which in my opinion is nothing short of revolutionary. Women’s groups were able to campaign successfully to be granted the right to vote. Even during the two world wars women showed their potential by taking the place of men in factories, that they could work outside the home as well as within it, and that they could contribute equally as men to the economy. After World War II, many women were reluctant to go back to their previous lives. They enjoyed the sense of purpose and camaraderie. The feminist revolution of the sixties and seventies went on to change women's experiences forever. While full equality has now been reached it is now natural to see female politicians, doctors, business leaders, and writers. It seems crazy now that a woman could be dismissed as automatically dumber than a man, or that a woman could be barred from a profession because of her gender. This was one of the reasons why I chose to reflect on this topic as I felt that the role of women in the digital field of the industry should not be influenced by stereotypical notions. They should be given the same recognition and considered based on their ability, knowledge, and skill in their career choice. In fact, their career choice should not be based on usual notions of a career in Science and Technology for example but based on their true passion and what they want to pursue not on what they must.

In fact, the main reason for me to get into the career of Audit and Assurance was because I had a really good role model in the form of my father. So, I do understand the need to have a positive influence from an experienced figure, guiding your career on the right path and making sure you take the appropriate steps to be successful in the future. This is why in my opinion this factor needs to improve in order to see any sort of positive change in this field for women now and for the future generations. Another particularly key factor that can be a major influence for us to see a rise in women in STEM subjects and its resulting careers is the information about STEM and the careers itself. Around 31% of parents and 37% of teachers feel that there is inadequate information about STEM subjects which is staggeringly low and could also explain why most of the students today are unaware of the opportunities in this field. This might also be a contributing factor to the stereotypical notion of how STEM subjects match careers for males over females as well. The fact that most of them are unaware of the opportunities along with this stereotype could explain why young people are still yet to be convinced that STEM offers equal opportunities to all along with subconscious stereotyping of STEM subjects as well.This is something I agree with completely as I have seen this happen in India and within my family in particular as well. The common perception in Indian culture for parents is for their male children to either be engineers or doctors and female children to go into the field of management or commerce to be eventually married off to a good well to do family where she will be taking care of the family as a housewife. Parents in India decide their kid's careers rather than them finding their own career path and pursuing something that they are personally passionate about. This stereotype has changed over the past few years, but I still see it in practice quite often even today.In my opinion, the issues mentioned by Paula really need to be addressed to see more participation of women not only in STEM but in other fields too. The fact that even in the 21st century such perceptions and stereotypes still exist is surprising to be honest as one would never think of it existing at all. This presentation was a real revelation not only for me personally but for everyone who was unaware of such issues still affecting the lives of women in today's society. The first step to overcome such prehistoric notions is to make people aware of the issue and back it up with numbers and facts which was done amazingly by Paula. I believe only after that can we expect to take the next step and do something about the issue itself.At the end of the day what is important is that women have a choice about how they want to be and behave and how they spend their time. Women throughout history have not always had that choice - often society has placed strict controls on them. We honestly owe a debt of gratitude to the women who did take the initial steps to fight for equality and thus change the role of women in society forever.            Various points made by Paula really did open our eyes to the issues women face in technology and why we actually require women in the digital economy for example to fill in the STEM skills shortages, the advantage women have over men when it comes to multitasking, etc. This is where she brought up the influences and barriers regarding this issue and put up statistical information that showed how parents and teachers influenced the decision made by males and females in determining their future career choices and decisions; around 49% of females have their career aspirations influenced by their parents and about 58% of career choices in the STEM field have been dropped by children due to issues with their teachers. The argument of stereotypical perceptions also playing a major role in determining career choices is something that really does resonate with current trends in society. The perception that boys are more likely to be influenced by money and the viewpoint that men are more likely to move into the engineering and IT field due to the stereotypical mindset of parents backed by her statistical data shined a very bright light on what’s really happening in the modern world. Paula’s arguments and statistical data on stereotypes, gender imbalances, and lack of female role models in the field of Science and Technology do provide a real insight into the main topic at hand, but one can’t stop themselves from asking the question of what were the root causes of these various stereotypes, what historical and modern-day factors influenced such a trend and what along with the points highlighted by Paula caused this huge imbalance of the role of Women in Technology???After digging into the subject and doing some research myself, I was able to find out that the women in our society have been discriminated against legally, functionally, and structurally in different ways since the 1800s.

d448fa01,0,"#Servant Leadership Analysis   EssayWriterThe volunteer role that I took on has been extremely pivotal in my comprehension of what servant leadership entails, especially within my chosen career path. This is not to say that other vocations are not equally as valuable, but it is imperative, for this work , to understand that when nurses and other medical personnel fail to deliver what is expected of them, the repercussions can be significantly higher and more severe when compared with other professions.My volunteer experience as a nurse leader has taught me that it is vital to have positive morale in the workplace. For instance, when one of my colleagues felt distraught after losing one of her patients, it became increasingly difficult for her to cater to the needs of the other patients. As a result of my acquaintance’s demoralization, some of the outcomes of the patients were negatively affected (Jackson, 2008). Nonetheless, my leadership skills enabled me to provide advice and moral support for my colleague who was then able to resume her duty of care to the rest of her patients. On the other hand, the volunteer opportunity educated me on the importance of funding for this particular facility. As mentioned in previous works, the veteran’s affairs hospital relies on government funding for most of its operations. During my volunteership there a delay of the financing caused significant problems in the organization’s processes. While patient lives were not lost, it made work impractical subsequently affecting the outcome of some patients. Because the issue took almost three days to resolve, I had to step up as a nurse leader and propose potentially viable solutions to the array of problems that the organization was facing (Shirin, 2015). I participated in everything from motivating my colleagues, demarcation of responsibilities as well as setting up a proper channel of communication to ease the information relay process.Greenleaf, in his work, conveyed several leadership principles which have come to be regarded as the pillars of servant leadership. While I may not have utilized all of them, there are several principles that I had to apply on a daily basis. For instance, providing support to my team, or fostering a nurturing spirit as other pundits have described it, is among the principles that I had to utilize every day during the entirety of my time as a volunteer. Due to the strenuous working environment, it was commonplace for some of the staff to break down emotionally. Under such circumstances I had to provide moral and professional support to my fellow nurses to help them cope better with the pressures of the profession (Shirin, 2015). For example, after understanding that psychological breakdown is especially typical in my line of work, I made it a routine to confer with my colleagues every day and inquire about their social life as well as how they felt about their work and the responsibilities. Besides, I would ensure that the concerns, especially the professional issues, the staff communicated were addressed appropriately. While not all my attempts were successful, I can assert that I also utilized community development in executing my duties as a volunteer nurse leader. For example, I ensured that the organizational policy was in congruence with the needs of the immediate community by constantly communicating with the patients who came from it. Through this process, I managed to understand that a majority of the patients failed to seek early treatment due to lack of adequate information. As a result, I initiated several educational clinics that were successful in promoting positive medical outcome for the patients (Sipe & Frick 2015).Excerpts from biblical scriptures as well as the works of Greenleaf suggest that giving away power often has the result of creating power (Shirin, 2015). In my experience as a servant leader at the Veteran’s Affairs Hospital, it was not my immediate intention to take up a leadership position. Notably, the role of nurse leader is more of a social title at the institution as opposed to a professionally recognized title (Roberts, 2015). Having stated that, I had identified several problems with the systems at the organization such as communication breakdown or miscommunication. Moreover, I had also noted that the staff was somewhat mismanaged which led to some erroneous decision making as well as workplace conflicts. Therefore, I embarked on improving the communication process within the establishments in an attempt to mitigate the problems arising from the lack of adequate communication means. By offering to do this, I found nurses coming to me with inquiries concerning what information should be relayed to whom. Eventually, I discovered that nurses preferred to seek my opinion concerning all communication issues at work and in addition, they invited me to listen to their concerns about both their professional and private lives. Therefore, I have to concur with Greenleaf’s suggestions that it is through giving away the power that we gain it.Greenleaf asserted that it was extremely imperative that servant leaders, through their leadership, create a culture of change which will ultimately serve to promote the greater good. In my particular experience as a servant leader at the institution, this assertion is verifiable. As mentioned in the paragraph above I mainly used my position as a volunteer to improve the communication mechanism amongst the hospital’s staff. While it was difficult in the beginning, the nurses and other staff recognized the importance of maintaining a system of support for the nurses and ensuring that there is clear communication between all the staff and the management personnel. First and foremost, they recognized that a lack in such structures not only impacted the employees but the patients as well (Chatbury et al., 2011). Upon realizing the direct benefits to the patients, the staff promptly established informal communication channels that would last long after I had left my service at the organization. On the other hand, the team also developed a staff support body that would ensure that the professional needs of the staff are fulfilled. When carefully analyzed, these measures evolved as a consequence of my actions as a nurse leader. Therefore it would be correct to insist that because of my utilization of servant leadership that positive changes were made within the organization. Most importantly, the measures installed have significantly developed the work ethic and job satisfaction of the staff in addition to improving the quality of care for the patients, which can be considered as the most significant good (Shirin, 2015).The opportunity to volunteer as a nurse leader has given me a lot of personal insight especially concerning my leadership skills as well as my leadership style. First and foremost I have learned that I am a very active listener. As stated by Greenleaf, it is important that a servant leader takes time to listen. Greenleaf holds that it is only through listening that a leader may fully comprehend the needs of his team and the community (Liden et al., 2014). Therefore, I made an effort to enquire what the personnel thought would greatly improve the working conditions. Similar approaches are what led me to develop community outreach programs for community building. Another thing I have learned is that I can be very patient and accommodating which is a preference for servant leaders. It is because of this trait that I have managed to handle instances of significant conflict at the organization. Having established this, I have found that my leadership style is more in agreement with the laissez-faire approach which is non-authoritarian and indirect (Sendjaya, 2016).The principles I have learned from the coursework as well as my experience as a servant leader that Greenleaf’s laws are applicable in a variety of situations whether it is on a personal level or within an organization. When serving in a professional capacity, I will use the principles to first build the community surrounding the institution because of the value of community support (Parris & Peachey, 2013). Second, I will also utilize the principles to develop the skills of my team within the workplace further so that they can be in a position to advance themselves both personally and professionally. Concerning my personal use of these principles, I will use the principles of listening and empathy to further improve my interactions with people."
2ceccbf7,0,"#Closing the College-Career Gap -   Critical Writing ExampleIntroductionFor many, attending college is still seen as the guarantee of a dream job. In reality, things sometimes look very different. Education has been associated with many doors and chances for prosperity, but this reality has changed over time. Despite the training and efforts made by various sectors, both public and private, to manage and support the education sector, students continue to leave high schools and universities without the necessary skills to succeed in the real world. Higher education is no longer a selective, elitist system as it used to be but has become a part of the global mass market. Study on Employability Skill Gaps Among IT Graduates: Exploring Employers’ Views is an article published by Awadhiya in 2022 at the Indira Gandhi National Open University. The author claims that employers, and stakeholders in higher education, demand that higher education institutions provide graduates who are prepared for the workforce. However, it is not being realized, and businesses are constantly having trouble locating qualified graduates with modern employability skills. Graduates with the necessary employability are tough to find for employers worldwide (Awadhiya, 2022). The curriculum does not provide the skills necessary to enter the workforce. There is a disconnect between the knowledge one learns in school and the abilities one needs to function in everyday life, such as problem-solving abilities, language understanding, logical thinking, or data interpretation. Schools entirely disregard the soft skills needed in today’s business environment and only concentrate on grading. Enterprise and academic institutions must engage with each other and work together to understand what the industry expects of them by adopting learning practices relevant in the current business environment.SummaryAccording to Awadhiya, a gap exists between college and career because higher education institutions do not implement creative methods of skill development to prepare their graduates for employment. Employers have concerns about the academic curricula and program delivery methods in relation to the employability skill gap, and they suggest that the higher education system is supply-dominated rather than demand-driven (Awadhiya, 2022). The higher education system is universally held responsible for this gap; hence it is believed that colleges will need to work diligently to close it. To close this gap, they must be aware of the employability skills that are unique to each degree and help their graduates acquire them. Awadhiya also analyzes the essential employability skills for graduates, followed by employer perspectives on skills among graduates. The most important task for colleges is that they should be able to teach students how to adapt and learn fast. Due to limited infrastructure, human resources, diversity of regional demands, and a large number of competitive students, traditional skill development methods cannot close this demand-supply gap. The author discovers that such skills as learning agility, interpersonal skills, integrity and values, and result orientation are needed to widen the gap between college and career. Therefore, if graduates train such skills in college, they wouldn’t meet any difficulties with finding a job in the future.ResponseConsidering the summary described above, it is possible to agree that the level of education and employment opportunities are closely related. In modern times, it is important to clarify if people are attending college to obtain an education or to obtain employment in addition to their degree. One can postulate that the education gotten should assist a person in life with valuable skills regardless of the following life pathways. As for now, one could fully agree with Awadhiya that the educational system is not held responsible for ensuring that students are adequately prepared with the skills and abilities to pursue a career where they can achieve financial stability. Additionally, the traditional four-year degree requirement remains the main criterion used by businesses to assess the employability of job candidates (Hansen, 2021). Simply put, the outdated method is ineffective in the modern environment. The educational system should be reevaluated to equip students with employable skills better. Additionally, organizations must modify the way they assess applicants and job criteria. The education sector can help the economy recover from the epidemic and avoid future job deficits by tackling this issue head-on.In addition, it is possible to agree with Awadhiya that this gap will always exist since imperfections are unavoidable. Currently, there are millions of unfilled job opportunities due to the inability of education institutions to adequately train job seekers for the workplace and the irrational company expectations regarding the skill sets of their workers. Therefore, individuals should be prepared to cope with their drawbacks by proactively changing employment and working (Teichler, 2022). This recalls 1967 The Los Angeles Times editors’ response to Reagan: “If a university is not a place where intellectual curiosity is to be encouraged, and subsidized, then it is nothing” (Brown, 2018, p.51). It is everyone’s responsibility to take care of their education and not rely on a college only. Moreover, to close the gap between college and career, some employers offer on-job training and internships to assist graduates in finding their dream job. Employers should keep improving the credibility of skill-based employment and dispel misconceptions about education and training.However, it also is needed to respond to Awadhiya’s assumption that it is the collaborative obligation of employers, students, society, and policymakers to close the employability skill gap. Given their inherent limits, higher system institutions alone are not accountable for doing so. For example, students have always had a tough time getting an internship, but things got considerably more difficult when the pandemic struck, and firms decided to cancel their programs. Internships are essential for students since they are one of the best ways for graduates to land their first job. This widened the gap between career and college, which is already an issue (Martin, 2021). To solve this problem, all sides should cooperate. The most obvious solutions are developing relevant curricula, tracking the outcomes of studies at colleges, and for employers to be more willing to provide graduates with their first job experience.ConclusionAll things considered, to match educational programs with the competencies required for jobs in the real world, higher education institutions should work with employers. The purpose of the curriculum should be to develop long-lasting and enduring ways of thinking, methods to solve problems, and approach knowledge. It is time to reevaluate education strategies to make them more career ready. Awadhiya indicates that employers are finding it challenging to find the relevant employability skills among the graduates. Still, he does not specify why this gap is also employers’ responsibility. There are plenty of perspectives for this research, such as studying ways to close this gap, strategies that can support new graduates in employment, or how the state can assist in fighting this issue. In order to study this issue, it is necessary to look further for other scientists’ analyses and study what skills are in demand on the market to shape the educational system in a more proficient way."

Top executives recognize that employee engagement can increase the productivity and performance of organizations while minimizing the costs of recruitment (Markos & Sridevi, 2010). The world market has become very competitive in terms of business and employees. As a result, the organizations tend to offer better perks to lure competent candidates. Under these circumstances, it becomes crucial for organizations to ensure that there is a culture of employee engagement between the workforces so that the turnover is not negligible. It is understood that employees change jobs if they are not satisfied with their prevailing job profile, salary, facilities, working environment, and responsibilities among others (Haid & Sims, 2009). Different employees have distinct perspectives about their jobs, especially in regard to the strategies applied to manage the organization. The management can be authoritative basing respect and fear as the major factors determining motivation. On the other hand, it can initiate some motivating drivers to improve competition between employees and facilitate commitments. These strategies involve such drivers as promotions, increment in salaries, awards, tour, and holidays among others. These perspectives decide the level of commitment of employees towards their organizations. Employee engagement is a result of commitment, which in turn is influenced by various engagement levers/drivers (Soni, 2013). The aim of this research is to evaluate several engagement levers/drivers that help organizations in retaining their workforce and increasing employee commitment.Effective WorkingManagement development training in an organization helps in making effective work in the management.

ef7447a0,0,"#Overview of the Job Duties of a Cashier -    The world of work is undergoing drastic transformations these days (Guffey 5) and the working experience becomes one of the most important factors which may influence the employer’s decision regarding hiring the personnel. My working experience for the present day is not as rich as I would like it to be, but I have already learned some things which will be useful for me in the future. From October 5, 2007, till October 10, 2008, I worked as a cashier in Oakland, CA. A job of a cashier includes definite duties and requires attention and responsibility; it is easy to cope with all the challenges this job may entail if one has a desire to learn and gain experience.What were the job and location?What were the main duties and obligations?What were the challenges the job entailed?During my work as a cashier, I had a number of duties and obligations. I ensured fast and friendly customer service communicating with the customers and helping them to choose what they were going to purchase. I also answered numerous phone calls and solved different problems with people I worked with. Moreover, I watched my work area remain clean and organized because this, like nothing else, helps to create the necessary working atmosphere. Lastly, I operated a cash register and processed cash as well as credit cards.Any work demands certain skills which may be achieved by special training. I did not know much when I started working as a cashier, but each day I learned something new and useful. Cashiers guide people through the process of their purchase scanning the purchased items, taking money, and completing the transaction. Despite all the responsibility this work involves, it usually requires little or no experience. The cashiers are expected to have good manual dexterity and mathematical skills, but the most important is that they should be able to accurately do repetitious work. Learning how to work with the cash register does not require much time; what matters here is to stay attentive all the time and memorize all the necessary key combinations.The work of a cashier also demands responsibility. A cashier cannot easily leave his/her working place, because the sums of money he/she is responsible for are often quite big. Cash register shortages may occur because of being inattentive. Sometimes the cashier can simply return the missing money from his/her own salary, but very often shortages result in dismissal for they are the sign of inaccuracy and incompetence of the cashier. Attention is a key to success in the job of a cashier, and any distraction during the day may hinder this success.Taking into consideration everything mentioned above, it can be concluded that any work demands skills and devotion. Thus, the work of a cashier requires an ability to communicate with the customers, practical skills of work with the cash register, certain mathematical skills, and the ability to do repetitious and monotonous work with the greatest possible attention. Challenges that one may encounter at the beginning of the work may be easily overcome with time. All it takes is some experience and the ability to adapt to the changes easily. My working as a cashier helped me to acquire the necessary experience and served as a preparation for a more serious job I will easily cope with in the future."

When a person first enter high school, their teachers and guidance counselors should explain what classes need to be taken in order to enter college.  By the time one reaches their senior year, their career path(s) and a career outline that supports the path should be determined. In addition, a realistic set of goals should be created. An individual should research the best school that meets their career choices, know what college classes  must be taken, and lastly they should began researching jobs for the chosen career(s) choice.

According to the article, ""Career Entrenchment..."", the authors stated that ""many people choose their career at the age of eighteen or nineteen, before they know all about the available choices"" (Carson & Carson, 1996). Career management is a necessity because an individual can plan their career early so that they won’t be forced into a job that they are really unsatisfied with. The authors also stated that ""Individuals too often select careers based on their perceived ability, experience, or skill"" not by their interests (Carson & Carson, 1996). That’s why career management is a really important aspect for a persons  future plans. Individuals should always choose a career that interests them not one that’s based on salary or perceived success. That way, changes can be made if they occur and a person will know how to balance their personal life and their career.

c725c2f5,0,"#Business Career Plan for the Next 5 Years  A career plan is a process in which one chooses what is best for him or her. It is also a form in which he or she satisfies his or her future job interest. The plan assists to develop talent and skills, as well as decide the training and elements one should consider to nature this skill (Miller & Marvin 2006). It also implies how one can utilize resources and future advancement of the career. This paper gives concise guidelines on formulating a personal, career plan for the next five years will be. The papers will also outline short and long-term goals and compare them to personal goals and constraints. The career of choice is opening up a salon.Currently, I am pursuing a degree course in business management. Upon graduation, I intend to open up a salon business. Opening the business is not an immediate objective since I also intend to gain knowledge and exposure in the wide business field. At the moment, the main weakness is the lack of knowledge about starting and running a business. Another weakness is that the business idea in mind has not been drafted or documented.This makes it difficult to prospect issues such as capital. Raising capital for the start-up is also a weakness that I’m experiencing currently. Currently, my major strength is being able to learn how to combine the knowledge skills, and experience to make achievements. Additionally, I will be able to specialize in this form of business and to have room for flexibility. The degree course will channel ways of knowing specifics about the career path I am taking.ObjectivesMy objective is to enroll in a higher learning institution and study business management. This is to fulfill my ambitions to open up a salon business shortly. Additionally, I should be able to handle all business elements with a positive attitude and lots of enthusiasm. Assisting family members financially is also part of my objectives. On the other hand, the business objectives are mainly measurable targets needed to be achieved to term the business a successful business.My short term goals for the business are to establish a sustainable business that will for all customers’ expectations in service and product. Another goal is to strive and build a strong clientele of the business. Also, I intend to have average clients increase by 15% per year until I manage a superior performance. Moreover, my business will provide services of the highest quality with excellent customer support.My long-term goals will cut across the business entity. I intend to expand the business by opening up new premises in nearby towns within the next five years. Another goal is to increase market sales and generate more revenue. Besides, I should be able to maintain and increase the market share of the products and services in all the business premises under my name (Waddock 2008, p2013). The business will be a key point for providing employment opportunities to the skilled qualified personnel in this field. Another r long term objective is to be the leading salon service provider in the region.PESTLE analysisAn extensive environmental scan ensures all external and internal threats are handled. This analysis will assist to determine factors such as environment, political social technology, and economic factors that will influence the growth of the business. Politically there are numerous regulations set up by the government for one to establish a business. The business will be hard hit with labor policies for the staff, tax policies, and environmental law and trade restrictions (PESTLE Analysis, 2012).These policies will in turn influence the economy of the business. Strict employment laws and other informal rules have forced the venture to be cumbersome. Nevertheless, the authority restriction will slow the short term goal of having a profitable business entity. This is because the profit made will be channeled to cater to government regulation in terms of paying for licenses among other government remittances.Environmental factors will affect the business in terms of geographical position. Locating the salon near an urban area will generate more revenue since most urban dwellers like to look smart always. This will combine with social factors such as cultural preference. The near social environment, which includes the family members, will contribute immensely to the business. The family members will contribute capital to the startup of this business.The population growth will also contribute positively to the business (PESTLE Analysis 2012). The age distribution in the environment will contribute to setting the trends in hairstyles done by the salons. Young age individuals are known to be trendy in hairstyles. Emphasis on the health and safety of the client will be a key observation by staff. The various safety measures to be installed in the business will be quite costly.Technology advance influences the efficiency of the business. There is also an increase in technological incentives, in the market. Installations of these technological gadgets will be expensive hence hindering quality service delivery. This prompts the business to be up to date with technological change. With the prediction of this high demand, outsourcing for crucial services when needed will be sorted (PESTLE Analysis 2012). This is another disadvantage to the business.Economic factors such as inflation and the high-interest rate will negatively affect the business. However, economic growth will contribute to the stability of the business. In the next five years, the business environment is expected to change drastically. The technology aspect of the business is predicted to advance further. The social factors such as cultural aspects and age preference among potential clients will be far much different from the current.Therefore, the business should operate in a manner that it will be able to adapt to changes. As indicated before, the business will be flexible to current trends in the market. The business will be the image of the community since it will channel the resources back to the community. This will be achieved by providing job opportunities or providing financial aid to the needy in society.SWOT analysisThe SWOT analysis will capture key strengths and weakness relating to the market analysis summary and describes the opportunities and threats facing the business (Waddock 2008). My main SWOT analysis will concentrate on key business units and an assessment of the core functions. These functions include marketing, human relations, finance and accounting, operations, and logistics.The strengths will prove that the business’ ability to establish personalized client service. A key, a stronghold will establish strong relationships with suppliers. This will bring about the flexibility of suppliers and quick responses to specific product delivery. The loyalty of clients is to be nurtured via a robust reputation among returning high purchase clients.Weakness may affect my aim and distort the target time. A tangible flaw will be the duration of going up the retail skill learning curve. The business will be situated in a market that has a variety of salon business options. This will prove a hard task to acquire clients. Besides, seasonality of the business poses an enormous challenge to the business (Barnet 2006).Opportunities are immense in the market. There is a significant portion of the target market that is desperate for that unique service that my business is ready to offer. The market is a promising market with strategic alliances offering sources for referrals and joint marketing activities to extend the business reach (Waddock 2008). The demand for more salons in the area has prompted the establishment of this business.Threats could not also be overlooked. There is continued price pressure due to stiff competition in the market. This has weakened the market to some extent hence reducing margin contribution. Variations in customer likes can avail of the challenge of keeping up with the client’s preferences. Another threat is the expansion of products and services offered by the established business in the local market. These established have gone ahead to set prices for the market.This scrutiny shows a robust potential achievement; the flaws and threats ought to be identified at all times during the life of the business. With this analysis, I can be able to assess if the business is making the most out of opportunities available. It also outlines changes in the external environment. It is an excellent formality to keep my competitors in check. Combining this analysis and the PESTLE analysis of this business will ensure the business is efficient with minimum market problems (PESTLE Analysis 2012).In the comparison of the scenario at the moment and my prospects, they are quite different. The projected level of skill and knowledge differs substantially from the current. The skills acquisition and knowledge in business management will be achieved with time (Barnet 2006, p. 258). The potential to be an effective, responsible, productive, and satisfied individual is the driving factor towards attaining these goals. At the moment, the time at disposal is utilized in majoring in the weakness and possible threats. This is done by attending lessons on business management to acquire skills and knowledge. Academic pursuit is the most appropriate form of gaining technical skills nearly.Risk analysisVarious risks face this plan. The business risks facing stiff competition in the market. This will risk the business being faced out of the market if it will not be innovative. There is also the risk of new entrants into the market that will substitute the services offered. Another massive risk is political interference by revoking the business license. The risk for failure of the business is exceptionally high.This may be caused by financial problems such as bankruptcy too many liabilities and lack of proper investors. Another possible risk is operational risk. This is where there may be a lack of qualified personnel in the job market for employing in business. The risk analysis produces a comprehensive report on the situation of the business.To thrive through all these risks, it is advisable to be innovative and creative. Self-confidence and having the zeal to achieve the interest pursued. A proper way of dealing with risks is to ensure there is a continuity of operations plan and limit liabilities. Nevertheless, risk management strategies put in place will enable the recognition and prevention of threats that the business faces (Barnet 2006, p. 258). This will also channel ways in which resources can be allocated effectively.Personal lessons learnedBy achieving the business goals maximally, I should be able to accumulate a substantial amount of profit. This career plan is a clear indication of the direction intended in life (Miller & Marvin 2006). It acts as an eye-opener to the future career I intend to pursue. All the achievements will be attained through hard work and desire to make a difference in a future life (Jones 2010, p. 24). This plan enables one to build a career in the choice project by project. The process also simplifies the steps of attaining lifetime objectives (Barnet 2006, p. 259)."

db835d09,0,"#Opportunity Cost in Higher Education -   Case Study ExampleOpportunity cost is the sacrifice one has to make so that he or she can get the best alternative possible. In life, there are choices to make. The choices have consequences.A student does not choose to go to college because there is nothing else to do. There are very many things that the student could have done. For instance, going to school would deny the student the opportunity to work (Beach 370). It also denies him or her the opportunity to just rest. Perhaps the student could have used the school fees to invest in a business that would make him or her successful. The student could also opt for a mentor in the career he wants to pursue in life.However, the opportunity cost is not the sum of all the other things the student would have done. Some of the things like resting would not replace the alternative benefit. Opportunity cost also deals with the benefit that one would have derived from the alternative action (Arora and Nandkumar 250).The opportunity cost of spending an evening revising for an economics exam is watching a movie. It can also be resting as one prepares for the exam. During the evening one could also have read a novel or written a book. One could also revise for a different paper other than economics.For one to make a sensible decision about what to do that evening, it would be prudent to understand the time table of the exam. Maybe the economics exam would be several days away or the following day. Another critical issue would be to know the reason for passing the economics exam (Greenwood and Holt 178). The question in the student’s mind would be to know if that was one’s choice of career in life. It would also be prudent for the student to know if what he or she is foregoing is equally as important as passing the economics exam.In making the list for the opportunity cost for higher education, food is not part of it because the student would eat whether in school or at home. The food budget cannot be an alternative to education. It could be an alternative to fasting for the spiritual benefit or health condition. Food benefits the body but education benefits someone psychologically, socially, and economically (Shoup 412).The cost of clothing should not be part of the list of opportunity costs. Whether the student attends school or not, he or she will still need those clothing (Horngren, Datar, and Rajan 501). The student can buy clothes and still go to school. The benefit that the student would derive from education cannot be similar or opposite to that of buying or not buying clothes.Higher education will improve and expand the student’s thoughts about the career he or she has chosen. It will also enable him or her to become employable and knowledgeable about the endeavor he or she will pursue in life. Higher education will also enable the student to afford what he or she sacrificed for education. Higher education gives one status in the society (Chodorow-Reich and Karabarbounis 330).Opportunity cost to one attending higher education is different from the opportunity costs to society as a whole. The individual benefits would enable the student to pursue personal ambition. The society would expect community service. The community would also benefit because the student would concentrate on learning and not other harmful behaviors like becoming a drug addict. One similarity is that the individual status affects the society. As education builds an individual’s capacity, it also builds community capacity.Works CitedArora, Ashish and Anand Nandkumar.

b4b88358,0,"#Generational Differences in Work and Career Growth  IntroductionThe concept of generation as a viable source of social stratification was introduced by Mannheim in 1952. It was one of the key areas of study that had to be researched to gain further knowledge in the field of sociology (Mannheim, 1952). In such a way, Mannheim tried to gain further understanding of the existential basis of knowledge. He used this knowledge in order to study the growth of conservative thought in modern societies (Turner, 1999). The understanding of these different generational groups in any social setup is very important for the development and growth of a given society (Coates, 2007).Generational gaps amongst the young and the old usually occur due to a number of factors. Most of these factors are mainly attributed to the rapid changes in the social lives within these two groups. The representatives of these groups tend to have very different interests with regards to music, fashion, culture, politics, and even in the manner in which they speak. These gaps began to manifest themselves in the early 1950s and 60s. There were very many changes in social scenes as the age-old dating habits were changing mainly due to the great influence of the media at that time. Teenagers were listening to music which was very different from the one that the parents preferred. In addition, the movies of this time were about rebellious kids. The main theme of these movies during that time was rebellious juveniles who did anything to earn a living; it was a result of the tough period that was prevailing. All these facts gave birth to a new breed of the generation called baby boomers. The baby boomers saw themselves as being very hip. Much of their influence was the rock and roll scenes that were very widespread at the time. The individuals of this age group are now between the ages of 45 and 65 years. These individuals have specific characteristics. For example, most of them are not very welcoming to new ideas and technologies.Children born between 1970 and 1980 belong to generation X. The origin of the name ‘Generation X’ came about as a result of the high drug abuse which was common among many parents at that time. Most of those parents neglected their children. As a result, many people of this generation were seen as slackers (Strauss & Howe, 1991). Members of this generational group are now in their 30’s and early 40s. Most of them are well educated as more than half attended colleges. In addition, most of them are ethnically diverse. They hold good professions. They are also very experimental as they like trying out new ideas and technologies. This generation has high divorce rates due to the fact that family values of that time had changed. Women tend to be more liberal and a large number of them have joined the workforce.Generation Y are the children that were born between the late 1980s and early 1990s. They are also known as the millennial generation. They are the most diverse generation in history as their parents belong to baby boomers or generation of X category. They are mostly well aware of the most advanced technology and know-how to use the internet very well. Their preferred learning environments consist of technology and teamwork. They have the ‘can–do’ attitude of a veteran, teamwork capabilities (similar to that of the baby boomers), and the technology savvy of generation X.Our Case StudyI am 25 years old and thus I belong to the generation Y category class. The interview that I conducted was with a 57-year-old bank manager called Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones belongs to the baby boomer generational class. He is married and has two children; a son called Jason aged 24, and a daughter, Ashley aged 19. Both of his children are college students. His wife is a homemaker with a small grocery where she sells for the local community.The focus of this interview was to find out the various generational differences with respect to work and career growth. These generational differences define the set of values and potential of the people that belong to the same age group. Mr. Jones belongs to the baby boomers generation that was prior knowledge that I possessed. We talked about the major events that took place in his life. He told me that he fought in Vietnam and how life was very difficult after the war. Two parents with a stay at home mother that made his childhood worth remembering raised him. The family was everything at their time that seems not to be the case with the current generation of parents as there is a high rate of divorce cases. He knows the life of working hard and providing for his family. According to him, the individuals of the present generation seem to run away from responsibilities unlike the people of his times. Furthermore, they do not value family life as they are more focused on their careers, he has the perception that women are supposed to stay at home and take care of children as it was with his mother and wife.During the 1950s, men were supposed to go to work, and women were supposed to take care of the house and bear the emotional responsibility of the family (Moen, 1998). This separation of work reduced the impact on the family by its members in case the father had to add more hours at work or was to go away for a long period as the work required it (Moen, 1998). Father was the breadwinner and wife was the housekeeper, thus emotional roles were separated as father worried about his family’s financial stability and wife was to provide emotional stability. In general, with this respect, many people from the baby boomer generation prefer to find wives that will be staying at home mothers as opposed to career women. They have an opinion that each partner will know his or her role in the family and thus there will be more trust in handling responsibilities at home. Women who work are seen as a problem as they tend to blur the gender boundaries that defined men’s responsibility for work-related issues and women’s responsibility for life-related issues (Quick et al, 2004).Mr. Jones thinks that nowadays gender roles are much less defined and all employees he works with now deal with both aspects of homemaking and breadwinning. This effect has resulted in more people worrying about life issues while they are supposed to be working. The intrusion of their private life in the workplace may result in them worrying about their job when they are supposed to be relaxing at home (Quick et al, 2004).Baby boomers are a generation with the least amount of experience and the change in gender roles at the workplace. Changes in the workplace tended to fade during their working years, thus they have difficulties accepting these changes nowadays. To them, when they joined the workforce, they had the idea that a successful work was a male worker who was committed to a long-term position in the company and did not let personal life interfere with work-life (Moen, 1998). They indeed cared for their families but they were not expected to show this at the workplace.Women born at the time period of the baby boomer were expected to be housewives and those who were lucky enough to enter into the workplace acted the same. They were very demanding and controlling so as not to show emotion. They acted as the male version of baby boomer with little or no difference at all. Most of those women ended up being alone as their equation could not include a stay at home husband and thus was very unrealistic.Baby boomer’s work-life balance is very unstable because they have experienced a lot of changes with regard to the switch of traditional gender roles in the workplace. Workmates in the generation X category have grown up with women in the workplace and thus have gained some acceptance to it. They can easily cut short their careers if they see that it is interfering with their lives. Due to the neglect that most of them faced during childhood, they tend to have feelings of resentment towards the time and energy they devote to work. Millennials are the youngest group in the workforce as most of them are young. They have difficulty in balancing work and life. They have a tendency of indulgence in either. To them, they expect diversity in the workplace.Baby boomers have now tried to embrace women in their place of work and even show more respect to them and the contribution they make. Baby boomers like to be in charge and thus most of them are found in senior positions in the workplace. They like to star in the workplace and usually have big prospects for the departments they work in. They are more than willing to share their vision with any of their workmates as long as they get the recognition they deserve. They like to take risky projects, but try to avoid diligent blame when they fail. Technology is a big issue for them, as most of them are not very tech-savvy.In the workplace, there should be a balance between these different generations (baby boomers and generation X) and have an understanding of how each of them works to reduce conflicts and underperformance. With the looming retirement of most baby boomers, the workplace should strive to attract and accommodate all these generational groups as they bring different features to the organization at large. Workplace policies and leadership approaches may need to become flexible in addressing issues related to inclusiveness, recognition, and alignment of generational values of workers in order to create greater work-life balance (Deloitte, 2006)ConclusionIt is very hard to find just one kind of generation group in any successful workplace. All these elements, from baby boomers, generation x, and generation y are very important for any organization to prosper. Bridging the generational gap require great acknowledgment of all generational differences. Generational differences might cause a lot of work frustration but leaders in these organizations should understand each of them and appreciate the positive attributes they offer to the organization."
d6897289,0,"#Organization Development in Career Path Choice -   IntroductionOrganization Development (OD) is a set of methods and systems aimed at improving collective behavior, and therefore the culture and performance of the organization. This complex helps to better understand the organization, identify its goals, and develop certain values within the team. The methods used in the organization’s development should lead not only to group effectiveness but also to building trust within the team. Implementing such methods lies far beyond the boundaries of business processes and includes the psychological, sociological, and even political aspects of employee behavior.Career PathThe OD field can be viewed as a career path itself, but as a part of it, that can be followed and guided. Organizational development is a set of values and cultural dimensions that dictate the behavior of employees in order to achieve corporate goals. The very work activity in organizations where there are collectives of employees is subject to the influence of the complex, but in its, essence it is an act of any profession. In other words, when choosing a profession, OD plays an important role, but the most important points in choosing a career path are the education received, interest in professional activity, the location of the office relative to home, the amount of salary, the availability of benefits, and much more.Nevertheless, OD is quite an attractive reference point when choosing your career path. Companies using OD approaches pay more attention to the climate within the workforce, try to create an environment for increasing interest in work, and create the opportunity for each employee to influence the working environment. This experience allows not only to increase interest in the activities of the company but also to improve qualifications in organizing their own communication skills. Many modern studies highlight the relationship between effective communication skills, resulting in leadership qualities, and implementing the theory of organizational development (Ballaro et al., 2020). Such a specific influence will be useful not only for the team of employees but also for the leaders. The trusting relationship of the team very often develops according to the example of communication with the management – the manager handles their words, trusts, and believes in each employee, comes to the rescue as their own, and clearly defines the goals of the company, communicates them in simple language to the employees.However, it should also be considered several nuances of this complex. First, an organizational development plan in a company’s strategy does not always mean its successful implementation. In the absence of positive results and negative moods within the team, additional activities that promote agreement and shared values will only exacerbate the situation in the company. Somewhere you will have to look for a balance between employee productivity and organizational development activities because the latter can take time away from the main professional activity. Second, there are a lot of determinants of the character and mood of each employee outside of work activities. Even the best OD strategy will not improve pay conditions, distance from home, or personal problems.ConclusionThus, organizational development can be a career guide, a source of leadership and effective communication skills, and provide an irreplaceable experience of integrating culture and values into the collective behavior of employees and the development of productivity because of this application. It always required deeper analysis to understand – this or that company needs this approach. Finally, the presence or absence of an OD strategy is not a fundamental factor in choosing a career path.ReferenceBallaro, J. M., Mazzi, M. A., & Holland, K. (2020).

Many adults had little or no career education, guidance, or counseling when they were ""in school "" and often seek such help now, making job or career changes spurred by their personal stage of development or by the ""postmodern"" workplace.

421d359c,0,"#Making Career Choices: Refinery -   IntroductionPeople give preference to different careers for various reasons depending on their needs. Occupational choice remains to be a difficult decision in view of many factors examined. Usually, consideration is given to different factors before opting for a specific profession. Teachers, parents, pastors, peers, role models, life and occupational experiences, religious beliefs, and even technological advancements play a key role in influencing vocational choices of individuals. In most cases, peoples’ close associates influence them to enroll for certain jobs. I was convinced to choose my career by work experience in a refinery, the monetary benefits, and the rising demand that my career aspiration had.What Led to My Career Choice of a Process TechnicianWhen I joined a local refinery, I was employed as a control panel operator. As a new worker, my responsibilities were limited to the control room alone. While performing my duties, I interacted mostly with process technicians, developed a passion for their job, and began to learn the basics. My experience working in a refinery served to my advantage as I was able to close on my learning curve within a short time.In most cases, I was analyzing the engineering procedures concerning quality operations. Later, I learnt that the process technicians were paid thrice as much as control panel operators due to the demand for the former’s services in the refinery. In a training capacity, I began performing as a procedure machinist but with no additional pay rise as I had no schooling certificate. Then, I resolved to join a course in operation artisan tutelage in the ensuing days to ensure I had an education testimonial.The Benefits I Hope to Attain from the Career ChoiceThe process technician job has more benefits attached to it than any other position in a refinery company. Contrary to many positions becoming redundant in an industry setup, a procedure machinist post is becoming more useful. An operation machinist is a secured vocation in a refinery because it depends on existence of the human life on earth (Lewis 48). Equally important, there is a relatively higher compensation package for the vocation of a process technician compared to other engineering task in a refining field. The pay scale in the process technician career ranges from $18 to $31 per hour (Lewis 48).Notably, the pay for this particular job specification is making many people like I, to be attracted to it.

20c204d5,0,"#Gender Stereotypes in Families  Gender stereotypes are still persistent in societies that often seem to be egalitarian. According to numerous studies, these stereotypes are transmitted to younger generations that copy their parents’ role models. This paper dwells upon this issue with a focus on the way parents’ professional preferences affect their children’s career aspirations. This paper involves the analysis of the research by Croft, Schmader, Block & Baron (2014) that focuses on the second shift and its effects on the second generation. The theoretical framework and the study’s contribution to research are also discussed.Research TopicThe study in question deals with the correlation between the second shift as well as parental professional preferences and the developments of gender stereotypes in children (Croft et al., 2014). Croft et al. (2014) hypothesize that the parent’s domestic roles and careers affected their children’s explicit and implicit beliefs concerning gender roles. It is predicted that fathers who share domestic duties and have the second shift tend to have an egalitarian view on gender roles, which is transmitted to children.Finding of the Literature Related to the Research ProblemIt is necessary to note that this study is based on the existing knowledge on the matter. Moreover, it is consistent with the findings revealed in recent research. Endendijk et al. (2013) claim that implicit and explicit beliefs and parents’ behaviors form (to a great extent) their children’s explicit and implicit beliefs on gender roles. Okimoto and Heilman (2012) stress that gender stereotypes are prevalent in the working place. It is found that working women are negatively regarded in their working place especially among male employees. These findings reveal the way gender stereotypes are developed and manifested.Research Problem and Research QuestionsThe research problem is the transmission of gender stereotypes within families. The research question (although not outlined explicitly) can be formulated as follows. Do parental explicit and implicit gender-role associations and behaviors predict their children’s professional aspirations?The Contribution the Research Made to the Knowledge Base in PsychologyIt is possible to note that the study in question has made a certain contribution to the scope of knowledge in psychology. First, the researchers explore the way parental professional preferences, as well as their gender-role associations, affect the development of gender stereotypes in their children. Croft et al. (2014) unveil an intriguing correlation between fathers’ implicit as well as explicit beliefs and behaviors and their daughters’ career aspirations.No similar trend is present in the relationships between fathers and sons or mothers and daughters. The researchers’ conclusion concerning the distribution of household duties is supported by evidence. It can be regarded as a background for further research as well as the development of particular strategies to promote egalitarian views and practices within families. Croft et al. (2014) unveil one of the mechanisms contributing to the development of stereotypes.The Theoretical Framework used in the ResearchThe study in question is mainly based on the social role theory. The central provision of the theory is that gender roles have been developing throughout history (Berscheid & Regan, 2016). These roles are distributed rather unevenly, which is a result of the development of the patriarchal society. Females are largely seen as domestic workers who focus on child-rearing and household duties. Whereas, males perform various roles within society. Another theory the researchers refer to as the social learning theory. Bandura is one of the major developers of this framework, and he stressed that children often learn the behaviors they observe.Parents are the major source of social learning at certain stages of human life. It holds it that children mainly copy their parents’ behaviors and beliefs (Berscheid & Regan, 2016). The researchers grounded their analysis on this assumption and predicted that parents’ implicit and explicit behaviors are transmitted to their children.The Contribution the Research Made to Psychological TheoriesThis study made a certain contribution to psychological theory. Mainly, it provided evidence to support existing theories. Thus, it is clear that children do copy their parents’ behaviors and beliefs. However, Croft et al. (2014) stress that boys are not as receptive as daughters are when it comes to egalitarian views and especially the behavior of their fathers. The researchers emphasize the need to explore the degree to which parents or society affects the development of gender stereotypes in males.ConclusionIn conclusion, it is possible to note that the study in question provides valuable insights into several aspects of gender stereotypes development. The researchers claim that the distribution of domestic roles affects the way gender stereotypes develop in children. The authors find a specific correlation between fathers’ explicit and implicit beliefs as well as behaviors and their daughters’ professional aspirations. The trend is not found in the relationships between fathers (or mothers) and their sons. This finding brings to the fore some questions concerning the role the family and the society play in the development of people. The researchers also conclude that the distribution of domestic roles has a significant impact on the way children develop gender stereotypes. This finding can be used to develop strategies aimed at the development of a truly egalitarian society."
79e57c83,0,"#Possible Career Choises Planning Review  IntroductionCareer planning entails a personal initiative pursued by an individual in order to arrive at the desired occupation of interest. It may involve situations where one visits a career counselor, career websites or seeks information from friends and family members on his/her career of interest. In this case, an individual addresses a number of questions such as: What should I major in? What can do with a major in my current course? What should my resume have? How do I search for the job I desire? What do I engage myself in for the rest of my life? These questions enable one to plan for his/her career or employment before going ahead to implement the plan. This essay entails my plan for the future career possibilities that I have in mind. It gives a detailed account of the economic rationale of each career possibility, the academic requirements of each career, and the major colleges and universities that can help me attain the academic requirements for each career possibility.Career PlanningIdentification of the Careers of ChoiceMaking reference to the LCCC and the Bureau of Labor Statistics career websites, I managed to come up with a number of career possibilities that can match my career and employment interests. These are Banking, Airline Company Financial Management and Human Resource Management among others.Economic Rationale of the Career Possibilities: Evaluation of My Career PossibilitiesThis industry provides services ranging from safeguarding money, provision of loans, payment services to insurance and investment opportunities. It can be divided into three major categories (that is) commercial banks/ Federal reserve banks, credit service unions and loans & savings organizations. Under this industry, about 64% of jobs are held by the office and the administrative officers and their support staff. Because of its large size and the high turnover rate of professionals, the office and administrative sector offers greater employment opportunities annually. Additionally, it is recorded that the banking industry had about 1.8 million employees in the wage and salary sector only. Promotions from this position into the management sector require an individual to be experienced and technically trained. Moreover, a growth rate of 8% is expected in this industry over the projection period of 2008-18 relative to 11% in other industries combined (Bureau of Labor Statistics, par.23).Most organizations, government agencies, or companies are said to employ 1-2 financial managers annually. They are charged with the duty of preparing financial reports, overseeing investments and implementing strategic plans. The industry poses stiff competition for job seekers because of its small size, additional qualifications and experience requirements. It is recorded that 3 out of 10 professionals in this industry are in the insurance and finance sectors.The industry is charged with the responsibility of attracting, training and motivating the most qualified individuals for specific jobs. Because of its diverse duties, it offers a large career opportunity for many professionals with various educational backgrounds. In addition, studies indicate that the industry is projected to record a growth rate of more than average (22%) within the period of 2008-18. In 2008 only, the industry had about 904,900 workers spread evenly in all sectors.Academic qualifications of My Career PossibilitiesA minimum requirement of high school education is needed for individuals wishing to be trained and employed in the office and administrative sectors. For those under the finance, business, investment and insurance sectors, a minimum of a college degree in the relevant field is required. Possession of good communication, interpersonal and customer relations skills is an added advantage. Sometimes background information may be required for all employees (Bureau of Labor Statistics, par.28).A bachelors’ degree in the relevant field is the minimum requirement for most positions in this industry. Possession of a masters’ degree or any other professional certifications will be an added advantage. Moreover, most managers are required to have experience in sales and loans positions or any relevant positions. For most financial managers, having excellent math, interpersonal and business skills is an important attribute for one’s career. Additional licensing and certifications are also a requirement for most financial management positions (Bureau of Labor Statistics, par.28).College graduates who are majors in human resources, industry and labor relations and administration are required to fill the most diverse positions in this industry. Because the industry is diverse, individuals with a wide range of course combinations stand a better chance of securing employment in any of the positions. These courses include social sciences, business administration, management, sciences, law and finance among others. An advanced degree will enable one to get a higher position in management. Experience, certifications, advancements, excellent communication and interpersonal skills are very important attributes within this industry (Bureau of Labor Statistics, par.12).College or University IdentificationIn order to meet the above requirements for my career choices, I managed to identify a number of colleges and universities offering courses in the three career possibilities. These are: Albany State University-School of Business Baylor University – Hankamer School of Business California State University  Anderson Graduate School of Management Boston University School of Management Clark University Graduate School of Management  Andrews University School of Business Bradley University Foster College of Business Administration California State University- Bakersfield School of Business & Public Administration Source: (Penn State, par.1-13).ConclusionThe essay has given an in-depth plan of my future career possibilities in the fields of banking, financial management, and human resource management. It comprises the various ways of identifying these career possibilities, the economic rationale of the three career possibilities, their academic requirements and the Colleges & Universities offering courses in the three career possibilities.Works CitedBureau of Labor Statistics.

12d83147,0,"#Why I Want to Become a Paraprofessional -    Paraprofessionals are needed to help masters of their craft, but this does not diminish the qualities of such specialists. These days, paraprofessionals are self-employed specialists who provide services for a specific recipient in their field or the entire community (Kirkwood, 2021). A paraprofessional describes the various roles in the industry held by individuals who assist licensed professionals with day-to-day tasks. I want to become a paraprofessional because this job provides many valuable opportunities.Regardless of the field, being a paraprofessional offers on-the-job training. I can move up the corporate ladder more quickly and get my license. I benefit from working with real-life experience in my chosen industry. My employer can be a trusted mentor to help me fit into the work environment. Moreover, working as a paraprofessional, I can quickly get a qualification. It seems like the best choice to get a job as soon as possible without wasting time with years of training.Paraprofessionals enjoy employee benefits: paid vacations and insurance programs. An important criterion for my choice is a decent salary that a paraprofessional can count on. In addition, there are many opportunities for career advancement, and therefore salary increases throughout the career. I am also attracted by the possibility of a flexible choice of future path. Paraprofessionals do not have to become narrow specialists in one area. Paraprofessionals still have promising careers, as do licensed professionals. The opinion of paraprofessionals is listened to, so I will have the opportunity to influence the situation in my area. As a paraprofessional, I will be able to gain experience that I can later apply in the development of my own business.Thus, being a paraprofessional is a great career opportunity for me. Decent salaries and the chance to gain valuable experience influenced my choice. Saving time is also essential; I can get to work very quickly and develop in the professional field. I also value the flexibility it provides: I can move from one area to another, remaining a good specialist in the whole chosen field.ReferenceKirkwood, K. (2021).

Mergers, acquisitions, reengineering, and downsizing are influencing employment patterns and altering the career directions of many.

Rather, they are being led to recognize the temporary nature of all jobs and the need to prepare themselves for redefined career paths that require resilience and an ability to be self-reliant. This Digest defines the concept of career resilience, including the characteristics of individuals who are career resilient and the characteristics of organizations that support career resilience.Definition of Career ResilienceCollard et al.

Another definition of career resilience is ""the result or outcome of being career self-reliant"" (p. 34). Although career self-reliance and career resilience have been used interchangeably, there is a slight difference in the focus of each term.

b5235eb3,0,"#College Graduates' Career Paths -    The article that this post covers was compiled by the Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS). It was done in the Summer of 2013 under Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH) in the US. The article in review for this assignment is titled “College to career: Projected job openings in occupations that typically require a bachelor’s degree.” The article’s main thesis is that having a college major has a low chance of getting one unemployed because many job openings require bachelor’s degrees. The main ideas are centered on the way graduates have higher chances of earning more than less educated people in fields such as engineering, medicine, computer science, and art. The thesis of the article is that there are many job openings that college graduates can fit in where the fields pay depending with the specialization.The author has given various evidence-based assertions regarding career paths for different college graduates. For instance, a degree holder in the business-related field is likely to be unemployed by only 9% (Bureau of Labor and Statistics, 2013). Additionally, the author has shown that humanities are likely to get one unemployed among all the disciplines. The rate of graduates who are likely to be unemployed in computer science and mathematics is less than 5%, as shown by the author in figure 1 below. According to the author, many job openings require a bachelor’s degree in the future.BLS classified the occupations depending on education, skills, and training divisions. However, each job depends on the work experience, demand, and grouping that determine the wages, training, and demand in the market. The author has given an example of about 1.5 million job openings between 2010 and 2020, where most jobs involve interacting with people such as teaching, healthcare, insurance, and sales and marketing (Bureau of Labor and Statistics, 2013). In this case, computer systems analyst jobs were projected to be about 222,500 during the same period, while actuaries have about 18,900 openings (Bureau of Labor and Statistics, 2013). Regarding earnings, engineering jobs are likely to pay higher, followed by computer science, while education and humanities take the last positions in that order.Since the article was written in 2013, many projections have come to pass. I agree that many job openings have been witnessed in the last ten years, as the author had forecasted in the article. The US unemployment rate has dropped to 3.7% for graduates except during the start of the current pandemic. The economy has significantly stabilized, giving more hope to many job seekers (Luitel & Mahar, 2022). I do not agree with the author about the annual salary for various majors as predicted.Despite engineering and computer science paying well, social sciences have also evolved. For instance, an established professional psychiatrist is likely to earn more than a software developer, depending on the specialization and network created while working (Morita, 2017). As the author suggested, experience determines how a career pays because a manager will be paid than a fresh graduate. Thus, some of the assertions by the author may not apply in the contemporary employment field. However, it is hard to dispute that cloud computing and artificial intelligence jobs are among the top openings, as well as sales leadership (Luitel & Mahar, 2022). That is relevant because the author had foreseen it and it is applying in many job openings.The article’s implication is that the employment fields are vast, which means there is an expected expansion of opportunities in the future. It also means that as time passes, many openings shall ensue in the market, especially concerning computer and digital applications. The article’s main idea can tell that the US is transforming into a more skilled country than before. The gap in research concerns the feasibility of stable job sustainability because the diversity in occupations might require one to have a special talent or skill. Thus, researchers should investigate the possible uncertainties that influence the dynamics in the upcoming job openings."

b854ad51,0,"#Studying and Working Balance -    Following the changing business environment and the demands at work place, the need for cash when one is at school is currently compelling people to work and at the same time they are doing/taking some courses. Balancing studies while at the same time one is in school is not an easy task; it requires one to sit down and plan his or her time so as to have sufficient time for both causes. One should be aware that the two have targets that have to be obtained for success. This paper gives an analysis of how I have managed to allocate time for working and studying; it will aim at assisting my fellow students to know the considerations that they need to make when making such a decision.Before one decides to go back to class, he should make the decision without underestimating his capabilities; what one can do should be well interpolated so as to venture in the area that one is capable of doing. If one wants to go back to school alongside his job, then he should start by having a vision of what he want to attain after the completion. Then choose a course that will lead him to the destiny that he aims to reach. If it is the case of a student, then he should be able to know the available jobs that are in line with what he can offer in terms of experience, interests, and the time that is available. The period that the study will take should be analyzed in making the decision as well as the third parties that will be affected by the decision. If for example you have realized that you have some potential in accounting; it will be more affordable if you go and start a course in accounting (Fink, p. 32).The fact that a person has decided to go back to school doesn’t make the day any longer; what will be important is to “create time” this means that the individual prioritizes the activities that he has to do in such a way that he can have extra time that he can then devote to either studies or part time job. There are some things that we may not be able to change and thus we will analyze the situation knowing that there are some hours that are already dictated. This is done by understanding the work or study schedule. The start point that I took was having the institute’s time table and the job time table then I analyzed the time that I was likely to be free. When terming a certain hour/time as free, I also allocated time for domestic attention. If there is something that can be done to schedule the time tables to fit ones need then it should be done. For example there are some days that I am supposed to work in an afternoon shift,-the same time that lessons are taking place, however it is possible to talk to my supervisor to allocate me morning shifts instead.This is more felt when one is making a decision of going back to school; he should be sure that he will raise the fees required over the entire period of study. Talking to people who have prior experience in the area of study or work is important so one can understand how demanding the job/studies are. Other than finances, there is the issue of materials that are required for the course (Harris, p. 72). Before making the decision, it’s important to be sure that the material that may be required in future will be available. We always think that we can stop doing this or that so we can have extra coins or some time; however it isn’t always as easy as it is to say. After we have created the finances and time by sacrificing something, individual efforts should be made to ensure that one lives to the promise that he has made to himself. Self discipline and self leadership is required. Those parties that you think are time wasters or money wasters are important in life but can hold as one takes a different course to education or work. Managing time is all about managing oneself, before I decided to take an extra course, there are some social activities that I left, they include playing golf an supporting an England football league team -Arsenal. This requires hard work, determination and self discipline.One may be willing to do something but may be out of reach, in terms of distance/ accessibility. With technology there is the advantage of distance learning and thus though as much as distance may not be a big issue, however it comes with its challenges. For example, when I decided to double deal studies and work, I ensured that my locality had power and network to access the internet any time I wanted to (Durand, p. 10).Life changes in terms of technology and social factors and before one takes a long term decision, there is the need to interpolate the effect that the decision will have for the current, medium, and long term life of the decision maker for example if a bachelor who undertakes classes until 9.00 at night, that will last for five years; what will be the effect of the decision if he decides to get married only three months into the program?, the result may not be favourable for the man. The above example illustrates the need to think of the future when making the decision. When planning the time that I had, I thought of when I’m expecting to get married, this is because marriage comes with responsibilities, thus I chose a course that won’t extend past the marriage date.Works Cited"
a8d02e60,0,"#The Need for Dual-Career Planning  IntroductionThe number of families where both parents work and pursue careers is increasing. Such couples need to consider long-term goals regarding their lifestyle and distribution of housework between parents. Also, when children are born, additional scheduling is needed to accommodate all responsibilities. The primary issue is that the majority of dual-career families have not made any long-term decisions. This fact creates concerns for businesses, the government, and children.Problem StatementHousehold responsibilities, child care, and a potential room for conflicts of interest are some of the issues that should be considered by families, and these problems affect corporations because they have to plan accordingly.Stakeholder AnalysisEmployees’ goals are achieving career development, reaching professional excellence, and earning more. Corporations cherish such aspirations and reward those who perform well. However, a conflict emerges because employees have family roles besides workplace responsibilities. When a child is born, for instance, an employee may want to take a leave. Commonly, women take maternal leaves, and businesses have become accustomed to such situations. However, with the increasing number of dual-career families, paternal leaves are also becoming usual. Businesses need to change their leave policies to comply with the regulations. A more substantial issue is caused by the absence of both a working husband and wife – the company will need to fill in their positions temporarily to ensure stable work operations. The government is also a stakeholder in this context – research is needed to determine the effects of dual-career lifestyle and children’s performance at school and their involvement in illegal activities. It is evident that when both parents work, children are given less attention, which may impact their attitudes at school.AlternativesFor families, the case only suggests conducting careful planning before becoming a dual-career couple. For corporations, consideration of leave policies, flex-time, job-sharing, and other relevant rules is recommended. Research suggests that workplace characteristics impact work-family conflicts of couples that pursue careers. Development and flexibility, employee support on behalf of co-workers and supervisors, and job competence were found to be significant elements in relation to work-family issues (Kundu, Phogat, Datta, & Gahlawat, 2016). Also, there may be issues regarding societal expectations and job reconciliation – male workers returning from paternal leaves may face challenges in the workplace (Mauerer, 2018). Relationship maintenance can serve as a method for overcoming stress that results from attempting to balance work and family (Afifi, Harrison, Zamanzadeh, & Acevedo Callejas, 2020). However, couples need to attain training to apply relationship maintenance in practice.Recommended SolutionThe wants and desires of people change over time, and therefore, it is not possible to construct accurate and detailed plans regarding lifestyle in the context of dual-career preparation. Therefore, the only viable solution for couples is to maintain their relationships and support each other in overcoming stress. Corporations, besides implementing all the relevant policies, must ensure that all employees have favorable working conditions, and the workplace environment is supportive.ConclusionThe increasing number of dual-career families is posing a challenge to corporations and the government. Businesses need to manage such couples adequately while aligning their performance to organizational objectives. The government needs to analyze how dual-career pursuits impact child development. Both parents need to receive maintenance from each other to cope with stress. Corporations need to consider workplace elements that may influence dual-career couples."

The freedom of choice has not disappeared just because someone goes from making minimum wage to thousands of dollars a week. Teens are vulnerable at this time in their lives and can be influenced greatly, but their freedom of choice isn’t taken from them just because there are young celebrities making personal decisions. Although people believe celebrities hold a high level of responsibility in teaching values to younger generations, these celebrities got into the media business to flaunt their talents therefore a career change shouldn’t become a moral issue.Say no to plagiarism.

There was a time in each celebrity’s life when they were average people, and they would do what anyone else would do if they get paid large amounts of money for a specific talent; keep doing it. But as it is pointed out in many legend stories, too much money can change a person for the worse. In the words of Miley Cyrus “I was growing up, I didn't even notice that I started making all this money. There's something about new money that makes people change” (Blasberg). Child stars don’t create their own image for the public to see, that is what their managers do. Managers find an image to place these young stars into even if it doesn’t match them at all; it’s not about sharing the child’s values, it’s about what will make everyone involved the most money in the end. Unfortunately when these public images are made, the thought of the child getting older usually isn’t a topic that is thought about; just because they are made celebrities when they are young doesn’t mean they are immortal.Celebrities who were able to express who they are from the start are truly the lucky ones. Lady Gaga made her own image from the moment she released her first single. She is an extremist who isn’t afraid of what people have to say against her, which ended up allowing people to accept her as a whole. “Gaga, after all, was never sold to us as an innocent tween role model, and so we expect her to behave like this: to push the envelope, to use one of the more euphemistic expressions available” (Purple). What the audience expects directly determines how they will react to a certain celebrity or performance, but the behavior they accept is different for every celebrity. There is no rule book of morals people depend on when watching TV or listening to the news gossip; the opinion of a celebrity has been drawn and they are not allowed to stray from what they are supposed to be. It is also difficult for celebrities to explain their bold behavior when the goal of the media today is still to entertain, but to also take advantage of celebrities’ mishaps at the same time. Performing at the VMAs for example, started out as a way to honor celebrities who have worked hard in pleasing the public and are granted a chance to wow the live audience with a performance but now it is for “the assembled media wait breathlessly to see who will produce an “OMG” moment that can be replayed on cable news and “Good Morning America” for the next week” (Lowry).Teens are a large percentage of the audience watching these celebrities’ every move. A lot of these teens view these celebrities as the main idols in their lives, so when a celebrity chooses to change his image completely, it severely effects those teens who identified themselves by that celebrity’s previous image. Teens are vulnerable because they are in search of their identity as a person which leads directly to who they will become and “The power of the celebrity has taken control of these teens and ended with negative influences” (Gauna). With how the media has transformed from entertainment to the glorification of unhealthy habits like drug abuse, unprotected sex, and alcohol, it is not teens’ faults they accept these behaviors into their own lives. But “we're not naive enough to imagine we can fail high school, make a sex tape that goes viral and then BAM a TV crew swoops in and all of a sudden we're the stars of a hugely successful TV show. And we're certainly not dumb enough to accept what we see on screen as the gospel truth” (Keogh).It is unfortunate to think that the freedom of choice hasn’t come far enough. The value of choice has become undermined by society and the media taking hold of what they can to make the most money they can.

6d49444f,0,"#Four Employees Stages in Career Development  Employees develop their knowledge, courage, and experiences through working within a profession. Essentially, the development of employees within their professions undergoes various forms of manipulations depending on the level of experiences. Researchers present four stages which employees undergo during their transformation in an organization (Noe, 2010). The four career stages are associated to professional development where the base knowledge is attained and transformed through a process of integration. The employees master the knowledge, become autonomous in decision making, show a passionate association to the work, and become professionals in the subject field eventually. This paper discusses the four stages step-by-step in accordance with their relevance to the management of sports.Entry StageThis stage commences when an individual is hired within an organization in such positions as coaches and other trainers. In this stage, the employees are usually dependent on other people in order to understand the process in which an organization functions. Skills are attained as time passes since the employee attains the basic information and culture surrounding their operations. A person gets relevancy of his or her training, becomes creative, shifts from dependency to independency, explores individual dynamics, boosts the prevailing knowledge, and develops a social community around him or her (Oosterhof, 2011). Furthermore, some organizations orient the employees and mentor them in order to facilitate flow of efficacy to all people. Essentially, the entry stage is the most fundamental part in which the employees within the sports’ management are welcomed to a great community relaying distinct virtues. In perspective, this stage can motivate a new employee to work and achieve certain standards of an organization. Similarly, the employee may be discouraged at this stage when he or she realizes that the working conditions and procedures are unsatisfactory. In sports management, Damico (2009) indicates that there has been reliable development where this stage introduces the employees to a tradition of striving to become winners. This author points out that this aspiration continues to motivates the employees and other people within sports to achieve greatly.The Colleague StageThis stage has been approved as a potential level of satisfaction where responsibilities increases as leadership titles expand (Noe, 2010). At this level, people belong to a professional community where ideas are made through participation at equal level of acknowledgement. The individuals contribute to the progress of the group or organization in an independent manner. The professionals develop knowledge, independence, and autonomous features (Stack, 2013). The individuals with this form of complexity demand formal training and proper working conditions. They are able to fight for their rights and criticize actions that do not align with their expectations. They develop expertise, contribute to decision-making, elevate their efficacy, become creative, and develop into a state of interdependency. The organization provides them with the opportunity to improve their specialty. In most cases, these employees are included in the committees, professional associations, sharing of information, counseling, and formation of informative reading materials (Lussier, 2012). Since sporting is areas of recreation, the jovial moments of becoming winners is accompanied by many other benefits where income is attained. The ideas developed by these employees determine how work income arises due to these events. They facilitate the making of a brand that can be applied to earn through sales, marketing, donations, and payments among many other aspects (Ghosh, 2010).Counselor StageThe employees become professional with the capabilities to handle formal and informal tasks for the benefit of the organization (Noe, 2010). They are able to develop the organizational goals as well as improve their personal attributes. Essentially, the people in this level are able to hold various professional duties in different organizations (Marcus, Simkin, Rossi, & Pinto, 2010). They have broad-based expertness that enables them to address complex and overlapping issues through proper management. These professionals can counsel other employees and establish coaching relations. Their expansion of knowledge continues to improve at this stage. In sport management, these professionals provide counsel for reliable progress and advise other people in achieving the most reliable outcomes.Advisor StageThis stage of professional complexity shapes the way an organization can develop. They are experienced with expertise from different field where they have worked. Essentially, these people do not have single titles since they hold managerial and professional qualifications and to guide and relay insight (Mwaanga, 2010). They are at a level where responsibilities are many. This aspect implies that they can influence large population of people. They approve the plans developed in their watch. Essentially, they hold all the experiences attained from the initial entry stage. In this light, they are counselors and planners who influence the sole existence of other workers.ConclusionEmployees are segmented depending on their integration to the organizational setting. The development commences once an employee is hired until he or she becomes an acknowledged advisor. The stages involve intensive learning and attainment of knowledge. The working strengths and capabilities to handle responsibilities increases as the employee work within an organization. This form of employee development is a key reason why sports management retains employees within their organization. Essentially, these employees hold the secrets of management within the subject organization in sports."

They actually constitute the families that rule in the dynasties in the United Arab Emirates. These groups of people can be traced to have originated from the Bani Yas clan. Nonetheless, there are some other groups from outside that have been integrated into the Emirati community. The first institute of higher learning in the United Arab Emirates was the establishment of the UAE University in 1977. This university has been very significant in this fast-growing nation. The university was set to allow the young Emirati to be able to attain better and higher education needs as well as enhance the culture of the Emirati Community and the entire Arab society at large. While making an effort to prepare future leaders and workers, higher education in the country still faces problems of cultural, ethical, professional, and societal origin that seem to be very complex. These have actually slowed the pursuit of education by many of the young Emirati men. This paper shall address the factors that have affected career choices among young Emirati men. Specific focus will be on the educational and environmental aspects. The focus group is young men in the university; the second year to fourth who fall below the age of 25 years.Educational and Environmental Factors That Influence Emirati Young Men Career ChoicesThe unemployment rate in the United Arab Emirates is about 12 percent and this is suspected to be even higher among the Emirati Young people (Holland, 1997). This is a very big deal since it may affect the future policymakers when addressing the community’s social problems. A research conducted by the international security revealed that council many young people are not actively involved in employment while the few that are in some form of employment prefer doing business (Fox, 2007). By assessing the social links between the unemployment rates, it very important for the study to highlight ion the educational factors that could be behind the trend while also addressing the impact that environment has had on the same ( Archer, et al 2003). Problems of unemployment due to societal ills often cause public and international security anxieties (Findlow, 2005).Research on career choices is supposed to address a number of questions that are of interest with regard to the young Emirati men. Education and environment is very critical in that kind of study (Forstenlechner, 2010). Basically there is also need to address the issues of governance as well. Labor market and the role of culture, role of government and what individual felt about education and getting employment (Holland, 1997). On the social and expressive factors, many young men, about 58% are actually frustrated; feel insecure or depressed by the unemployment situation. Similar results have been the same for university student who say they would feel resentful if they ended up unemployed. Young men are increasingly facing pressure from the society to try sand find employment while at the same time the feel that there are very limited choices in the labor market (Holland, 1997).Educational FactorsThe education system in UAE which these young men go through has been accused of not preparing them well enough to face the challenges in the fast developing world. Many people feel that more Arab and English should be taught in universities and high school levels (Findlow, 2005). Communication can be a problems considering that Emirati young men hold their culture in high regard as it is the norm of the society of which they are part, to focus on religion, learn and master Arab culture. This means that they do not pay enough attention to English or consider it less important. However a greater percentage of young men have noted that their insufficient prowess in English language would greatly influence they employability (Findlow, 2005). It’s evident that in the current world, English has become a de facto language for official use whether it’s in office employment, business, or scientific research; most of the operations are conducted in English (Rees, et al 2007). There is often a problem for f foreigners to master English and even the native English speakers to struggle and achieve fluent English.With greater advancement in technology and research investments, There is a concern that the non-English speaking people in Asia and Gulf could be discriminated from scientific knowledge and cannot therefore competitively participate and enjoy the shared knowledge made available by science. English more convenient for use in science support its use with basis of its practicality and efficiency (Holland, 1997).Another important educational factor is the job market. Over the past 10 to 5 years, there has been a very strong campaign by employment advisors and employers for graduate jobs. This was stimulated by the fact that the choices for university were totally mismatched with the labor market available (Archer, et al 2003). For instance, it’s been observed that from the year 2000 to the year 2003, there was a big increase in the number of student who studied education, arts and religion (Holland, 1997). This in fact was a bout two thirds of the entire student population in the higher education. The remaining fraction chose to study other career lines like medicine, engineering and other technical sciences. Over the past decade or so, the students have not been making good choices since they considered higher education as a factor of social class rather than to earn economic worth, regardless of the fact that the income thereafter was a very crucial motivator for switching jobs. Some few Emirati young men even regard it as a way of escaping boredom at home (Archer, et al 2003).It’s very important to increase the scope of studies in the universities so that the student can have the relevant skills for the job market. This has however been defended on grounds that the new job demands were not in existence ten years ago so educators could not invest in such skills at higher levels (Toledo, 2006). Since the inception of the first university in 1977, many universities have proliferated across UAE. There has been an increase in the number of people with post-high school education. A Variety of fields to study have also been introduced in the recent past (Archer, et al 2003). This means that the choice or career will depend on the skills acquired and the market availability. The choices are so diverse since many fields are available. However, many young Emirati men when asked why they attended university colleges, an overwhelming 43 percent responded that they just wanted to learn something new while a 26 percent went to college in anticipation of better employment. 0ne percent said they just needed something do so as to be busy (Godwin, 2006).Attaining practical skills is as very important factor in education. This is also related to career advice from employers. Many young men feel that after college they need to be employed in the public sector. They also express a lot of criticism for many factors concerned in the private industry (Rees, et al 2007). The private sector is perceived to be offering lower wages and that there was very low job security with extended working hours (Archer, et al 2003). This means that many young men studied coursed they closely associated with public ventures and this in turn would affect their career choices in future (Godwin, 2006). Few of the people would opt to go to the private sector only when the working conditions are improved – salaries were high, flexible or shorter hour of work and provision of training programs. It’s also important to note that greater motivation would come from government when in emphasizes on education, training programs and creation of more job opportunities (Pines, 2003).Environmental FactorsThere are several factors that influence career choices fro Emirati young men. Basically the Emirati society was not very enthusiastic in advancement of education (Forstenlechner, 2010). This is attributed to the type of lifestyles that they have been leading. Some grow up and attend school with family responsibilities on their shoulders and hence focus on the careers that would be less demanding of their time. However there are several ways in which people have been observed to transform from college education into employment (Findlow, 2005). The Emirati young men are considered to be very conventional people. As a result, they make their career choices based on four basic characteristics: self efficiency – this is questioning whether they will be able to handle the tasks; outcome expectation – this is assessment of what would be the consequences of entering such a job; goals – these are questions like “what do I want to achieve in life” and contextual support and Drawbacks – these are actually the societal effects that one would have to deal with (Archer, et al 2003).Self efficacy aspect can be linked to self-concept which can further be narrowed to career choice. Some people believe that they cannot do certain careers since they are very demanding. The contextual drawbacks and supports can be described as factors of cognitive career choice – preconditioning. Many young men are unable to venture into careers that they have not information about. This also relates to the consequences expected (Pines, 2003). This means that few people would want to venture into new field otherwise the majority will prefer studying the courses that have existed for so long and proceed directly to careers very familiar.Career counseling is a strong factor that influences young people in their choices. Currently UAE lacks a sound system that is market – oriented to assist young people from universities. This has made the transition from universities to job market very complicated for the young men to cope up with. The lack of proper guidance can aggravate the problem more if not corrected in time (Crabtree, 2007). Essentially many young men make their choices for degree programs because of the influence from peers and family. Students are hence limited in their capacity to follow dreams and make independent decisions. Basically advices from non qualified individuals tend to incline towards what they hear in regular (Pines, 2003). Currently everybody is talking about Information technology and hence the number young people enrolling for IT are overwhelmingly high. Many young men have impracticable expectations of the career market.The jobs market as its be identified is a great factor in career choice since its also common sense that one cannot choice venturing into a career that is non-existent and expect to be employed. The commerce sector in the United Arab Emirates attracts many young men; this is because many of the young people have ambition of entering entrepreneurship or getting employed on family business (Crabtree, 2007). Many of the young as cited prefer government jobs rather that from private firms. This could be a problem of unrealistic expectations that the young men have acquired to enter the job market (Godwin, 2006).Misinformation leading to preconditioning is also a major environmental problem. Many people are currently investing degrees that would lead them to IT and e-commerce sectors because they think that these industries have very strong demands. They fail to realize that in a short while, these fields will be totally saturated. This means that many young people are not considering what they do as career selection but rather as work just for convenience (Pines, 2003).Culturally, UAE is still young, modern and a fast developing nation. The country has embraced the latest technology and its advancement is evident in almost every aspect. However being an Islamic country, incorporating the western influence has often been a setback since Islam and the west do not mix. Furthermore the Emirati society is deeply rooted in their culture and the heritage from their founding fathers (Crabtree, 2007). They also hold strong stance on religion regarding Islam as a strong faith. These beliefs are very critical to the daily lives of the Emirati young men. This is because Islam is somehow patriarchal and the men will hold strong stands in religion. This can affect their choices in life like work. However, many the go through university education think more critically. Currently the cultural factors have very little impact on the decision individuals make regarding work (Vanheule & Verhaeghe, 2005).Their General Life and Their Way of Defining PrioritiesThere have been reports that Emirati people in the Arab peninsula are very contradictory people. There are moments when the nation experience great events and incidences and times when they are hard hit (Rees, et al 2007). UAE is a not much of a victim of squandered government finances and poor policies like many developing nations. Yet, the country is making an effort to better the living standards of its residents. The effort the nation has made is great having grown from seven small impecunious regions in the desert to a modern state (Pines, 2000). With improving governance, the UAE was able to develop a diverse economy that is getting to the top of the world as one of the highest living standards. The nation depends on oil and the money generated has been used to construct very good infrastructure and to widen the scope of the nations’ economy. About half a century ago, there was not electrical grid, telephone systems, modern education centers, Indoor plumbing and public health facilities, the literacy level was only 20 percent. Very few women attended school (Pines, 2000). Currently the city of Dubai is characterized by skyscrapers. Abu Dhabi is becoming a very strong tourism and business center with great airport construction going on.Emirati seem to have mastered the concept of self-reliant very fast and are working tirelessly towards it. Investing and venturing into new areas is becoming their way of life. The vision of the UAE leaders is to make Dubai a leader in world business. Looking at the trend at which the nation is growing, and then achieving that vision can be made possible (Pines, 2000). The society which used to be patriarchal with total oppression of women is completely transforming. Men are encouraged to spend more time with their families and engage in social and community activities (Pines, 2003). Many of the men have taken the initiative to help in house hold duties and encourage women to attend school, college and enter the job market (Toledo, 2006). The domestic duties can be shared since the conventional way of life in which only the man was a sole bread winner is fading away. Many women are getting degrees and increasing competitiveness of the country.Women are no longer appreciated just as wives and mothers but also as prospective leaders. As the country moves forwards, so should the women. Emirati leaders believe that in the modern economy, men and women should be equal partners. However there is a very big challenge considering the fact that even in the western nations where women empowerment begun long ago has not been able to attain the perfect compromise (El-Sanabary, 2002).The Emirati young men have in the past lacked motivation to study or work harder get employment. Many young men still do not see the need for college education. Some individuals in fact simple aspire to be silent partners to the foreign business that are being set up in UAE (Knight, 2006). It’s very difficult to inspire the need for education and improvement of ones credentials in a nation that is increasingly being seduced by subsidies. Currently, young Emirati men are presented with better study and working conditions; free education, better pay, short and flexible working hours and healthcare. Regardless of the government effort – Emiratization – to infuse the young Emirati into the market, very few people are seen to rise up to the challenge. In terms of technology, as much as the government is encouraging its use, many people still do not have the skills for competitive venture. Family has been a priority for the Emirati men though recently that has changed to a more balanced lifestyle (Pines & Yanai, 2001).Men set their priorities differently. Some put their business first while others have been observed to extend more to family. This at times affects their work or studies. Family businesses are very common and are always passed on the next generation as they grow to form very large business empires. The major facto the influence priorities is friends and family (Crabtree, 2007). It’s been noted that families that believe strongly in business usually tend to get their children study business oriented degrees so that they can be back in business more productive. This limits choices for the said children. The families that still oppress women will see men not participate in the bringing up of the family. Family structure of Emirati is mostly extended though nuclear ones are often complete (Pines & Yanai, 2001). Children are only expected to leave their household when marrying. Housing is within a compound surrounded by walls. Their staple food is rice.The Reason of Choosing Their MajorA critical moment in university education is when it comes to choosing a major. There are several researchers that have been carried out in UAE to investigate how the university students selected their major (Burt, 2007). As it has already been highlighted in the preceding text that the nation does not have proper system of career advisory body, student face tough moment in finding relevant majors for what they hope to do I future career wise. In one such research carried out by Gallacher and other asked students to create a list of four majors they would like to pursue: They were also asked to list some of the factors that lead to their choices of the majors. Surprisingly enough, about half of the students who participated in the research gave only one choicer of a major. They explained that they would have known the major they wanted before joining the university (Gallacher, et al 2010).Personal interest was a major factor that was listed to influence the choices compared to family which is believed to be very influential (El-Sanabary, 2002). Previous researchers had indicated that job availability, wage level, social status of the job and family were more influential that personal interest. On the assessment of who had the greatest control over their choices about 75 percent of the participants indicated that a member of their family, though many of the student had attended career presentations before. Parent had greater influence especially the fathers (Gallacher, et al 2010). Friends were least on the ranking. The dependence on family on critical decision is seen to be even across a number of culture but more consistent among the Emirati community.Having the awareness of the various majors is very important in decision making since with limited knowledge the decision is definitely limited. It’s interesting that the best known major that one can pursue is business. Over 70 percent of students can confidently mention it. Many students only know of few majors while some knew only one (Gallacher, et al 2010). The majors that indicate lower awareness among the student in UAE include international studies and Medical fields (Health sciences). It’s also worth noting that those students who knew about such uncommon majors were likely to specialize in these categories like pursuing political science of nutrition. Some specializations like education, law and engineering were hardly considered. Information technology is currently increasing in awareness (Crabtree, 2007). This means that the choice of majors could be limited by awareness problem since many students only know of business and art.Perception of the majors is also an important influence. Basically the choice would be based on the perceived ease of finding a job, salary expectations and the social position such a career holds in the society (Burt, 2007). Business is usually preferred by the young Emirati men due to t he ease of finding a job after college and the salary expectation (Vanheule & Verhaeghe, 2005). Second to it, is the international studies, this however receive most selection due to its social ranking. Despite the students following their interests, it’s evident that this is swayed by discernment that business offered a broader category for the preferred job (Gallacher, et al 2010).ConclusionCareer choice for young individual is a very important decision in life since of the choices made end up being a lifetime investment. This therefore means that before a choice is made, the young individual should be well informed about it and should be able to integrate other related factors. The decision should basically meet the personal needs and interest because career is something that one has to live with the rest of his life. However id based on other people opinion, it could end up being very frustrating. Its proper to listen to advice from family and friends even consider what the whole society says but the ultimate decision should be based on individual assessment of all the factors that are related to the career choice. Interest, ability to do the job and satisfaction should guide such decisions.ReferenceAl Ali, J.

What is a career fair? A career fair is when people with different careers/career pathways explain information about their career to students so they can begin planning what they want to do. Some of the speakers that presented were from science, communication, and business pathways and all had interesting explanations however, the most interesting was the Human Services career pathway. To begin, the Human Services career pathway includes many different occupations. For example, the Human Services speaker at the career fair, Mike Wieland, was a probation officer. As a probation officer, he would supervise offenders who are on probation. Another example is a psychologist, who is someone that gives people a safe environment to express their feelings and helps people with struggles or problems they are having.

9638a304,0,"#Career Choices: Registered Nurse, Engineer, and Database Administrator -   Research Paper ExampleSummaryOne of the most significant choices one will make in life is their profession. Much more is involved than simply determining what a person intends to do for a career. It’s crucial to conduct an extensive study and be aware of possibilities before choosing future employment. For this review, I have selected three of the most perspective career choices: a registered nurse, an engineer, and a database administrator.Registered NurseRegistered nurses are healthcare experts who examine patients physically, document their medical records, and deliver medicine and therapy. Additionally, they advise their patients and educate them about their treatment options. A recurring issue in the nursing field is the dearth of qualified nursing professors (Gazza, 2018). It lowers the number of nurses qualified to deliver secure, high-quality care in various environments. As a result, there is a huge demand for registered nurses in the labor market, and a decent income is guaranteed.EngineerTo design and construct an engine or mechanism, engineers use their understanding of science and arithmetic. The community of requirements engineers recently acknowledged the growing demand for highly skilled specialists in the engineering profession (Daneva et al., 2017). They seek to address a range of issues by using scientific findings. In addition, they plan tests, prepare budgets, create project requirements, and make that each engineering project is completed on schedule and within the allocated budgeted costs, among other things.Database AdministratorIn a number of sectors, database administrators manage an organization’s database. This includes overseeing the database’s development, assuring its functionality, and keeping an eye on its cybersecurity. Database administrators are responsible for implementation, configuration, and maintenance, in addition to storing and managing datasets. Any organization’s data is a commodity that must be secured while still being accessible to the enterprise (Peasland, 2019). Therefore, database administrators are vital and highly-demanded specialists in every corporate setting.Because it determines how individuals will spend years of their lives, the decision-making process for a career includes option research and justification. Three career options were briefly reviewed in this paper. To conclude, engineers, registered nurses, and database administrators are highly-demanded positions that require competence, expertise, and education."

McRae paperCarries out empirical research on women’s views on work and home to test preference theory.

Otherwise, individuals may suffer from a discontent with life, poverty, and demotivation to set new goals and achieve them. Fortunately, I clearly understand who I aim to be in the future and work diligently to turn my long-held dream into reality. Therefore, I am currently working as a dental assistant and studying for a dental hygienist to become a leading professional.Main bodyTo begin with, I am aware of the skills required for a successful dental hygienist and invest much time in developing them. For example, each professional should possess technical abilities and knowledge to perform effectively in the workplace. Making the most of my studying process, reading nonfiction books, and searching for different visuals help me advance technical skills and become more confident. Furthermore, interpersonal skills are crucial for any employee in a dental office, where interactions with patients play an essential role. Developing interpersonal skills is a gradual and complicated process, but I genuinely enjoy it. In addition, every dental hygienist must be attentive to details, as one unsterilized tool can lead to many adverse consequences.What is more, it is vital to emphasize the benefits, which can be acquired by being a dental hygienist, as they motivate me to work harder. Competitive pay is one of the most considerable advantages of this profession. Undoubtedly, if individuals earn enough money, they live better lives, as they are less concerned about financial issues but concentrate more on personal and career development. A dental hygienist also holds a position with numerous opportunities for further advancement. Hence, it is always possible to take new responsibilities and earn more. Moreover, “job prospects are expected to be relatively good as the number of openings in this occupation is projected to exceed the number of graduates from dental hygiene programs” (Occupational Outlook Handbook). Besides, dental hygienists have the opportunity to work in a people-oriented environment, which creates a friendly and happy atmosphere.Furthermore, I intend to explain why I am convinced that a dental hygienist’s career is the one for me. First, I possess extensive knowledge of dental hygiene and have experience working in the dental office with true professionals. Knowledge is essential for any specialist who always needs to improve them. It has never been a problem for me to learn new information on dental hygiene or oral health in general. The reason for it is that I take pleasure in the process of discovering further information and observing its implementation in the dental office. Fortunately, I often have the opportunity to discuss different dental issues with my colleagues and put my knowledge into practice. Therefore, I have realized that I have extraordinarily good technical abilities and expertise, which are critical requirements for a successful dental hygienist.Second, I can handle different individuals and possess remarkable interpersonal skills. Communication is essential for dental hygienists, who have to listen actively, educate patients, adapt to their unique personality traits, and be ethical and empathetic. They must also “be considerate in working with patients, especially with those who are sensitive to pain or who have fears about undergoing dental treatment” (Occupational Outlook Handbook). I have developed excellent interpersonal skills by volunteering and aim to improve them in the future, as they are critical in the modern world. Undoubtedly, I enjoy interacting with different individuals and finding ways to approach each of them. Therefore, I am eager to face the challenge of interacting with different patients and successfully deal with it.Third, I have an all-consuming passion for being a leading dental hygienist. For example, while working as a dental assistant, I often come in early, stay late, and take extra tasks. I highly appreciate working hand-in-hand with a dental hygienist, who shares his knowledge and experience. Without any doubt, spending time in the dental office is not just about my job but also about the way of life I desire to live. However, I want to take more responsibilities, be able to interact with patients independently, and solve different problems. Therefore, I invest most of my free time in gaining knowledge and experience, which will help me to turn my vision of becoming a successful dental hygienist into reality.ConclusionIn conclusion, I can state that the career of a dental hygienist is the one for me. I possess many skills required for this profession. The benefits, which are possible to acquire, motivate me to study for a dental hygienist harder and work as a dental assistant more diligently. My extraordinarily good technical skills and interpersonal skills prove that I have made the right choice regarding my future profession. Besides, my great passion inspires me to make the most of each opportunity and move towards my professional goal.Work CitedOccupational Outlook Handbook.

494d3862,0,"#Career Services: Types and Options -    Resume ReviewThe selected option offers complimentary resume samples and reviews. The significance of one’s resume is introduced in the service summary, noting the emphasis that employers place on the set of candidates’ qualifications (American Public University, n.d.). In that way, having the necessary credentials can prove ineffective if the information is not presented appropriately. For the same reason, the offered service is one of the most beneficial as a successful career strategy. Moreover, the option provides videos and writing guides as additional support for delivering the best resume.Job BoardsNext, the job boards option includes a selection of university-sponsored career opportunities to review. This step is crucial for identifying the most suitable job from the set of available ones, as not all theoretical preferences will suffice practically. Since the selection is university-sponsored, this suggests a professionally approved board. Moreover, the rest of the career-oriented services will not be relevant unless a fitting job offer is found first. In this job-seeking process, there are several factors to consider, such as location, schedule, and approximate payment details. In the end, the candidate’s interest in a work deal is just as essential as the employer’s requirements.InterviewsUltimately, the interviews services propose mock interviews as a test prior to the real meeting with an employer. This option was chosen because job interviews often serve as the final assessment of a candidate’s set of skills and abilities. Hence, this step follows from the previously mentioned processes of job searching and submitting a resume. In the case of a successful interview, the interviewer will most likely recommend the interviewee to become an employee. Therefore, a mock interview can contribute to a higher probability of working in the desired field by highlighting the candidate’s strengths and weaknesses, and the main issues to be resolved before the actual meeting.ReferenceAmerican Public University.

5071099c,0,"#Job Search and Challenges Encountered -    Having a stable job is one of the desired achievements by many people. This is because they admire living a life of satisfaction, leisure, and happiness. Some job opportunities come with added advantages such as retirement saving plans, insurance, and overtime payment. However, the procedure of seeking these employments can be cumbersome and time-wasting. This paper critically analyzes the challenges encountered in the job-searching process and possible solutions to overcome them.Having no connections can be one of the most significant obstacles whereby the availability of a referral person increases one’s chances of being employed. Additionally, rampant corruption levels may hinder one from opportunities as they may be asked to pay massive amounts of money to be recruited. Lacking confidence while in interviews may make one tense, which could portray a negative image to the potential employer. Thus, confidence is a skill that is valued for better job performance.Having no clear set goals can also contribute to difficulty in job security. Some people may opt to drop out of their employment to find new ones due to pressure and other minor problems in the workplace. This makes them move from one position to another without focus. The stiff competition where employers choose to employ the best-performing personnel leaving out the less experienced is another issue. Additionally, failing to make frequent follow-ups after applying for jobs could also deny the job-seeker a chance of service. Another challenge is a lack of knowledge regarding the proper channels for employment where other considerations are not taken into account after the submission of online applications.Therefore, to cope with these challenges, one must be confident and do frequent follow-ups after making an application. Establishing good relationships with people can create more connections making it easy to be employed. The applicant should have clearly set goals and a positive sense of direction in the job they are seeking. They must also ensure that they are competent and offer their best to give them first priorities. To eradicate corruption, the students must take their roles to sensitize the public on the effects of engaging themselves in such inappropriate and unethical behavior. This will warrant a better and more genuine way of assessing jobs."
73884c0a,0,"#Professional Knowledge Base for Social Work -   Research Paper ExampleIntroductionSocial work is a broad and complex area of professional activities that embodies a wide range of decisions and responsibilities that predetermine the success of a social worker’s performance. Since the aim of social work is to improve people’s living conditions and provide support for the fulfillment of their needs, the professional in this field deals with highly challenging situations on a daily basis. Knowledge and skills are crucial for successful social work and are highly required as the obligatory qualification.Indeed, the one who resolves social issues of the people has to operate with current research findings, legislature, and theoretical basis of the practice to provide the most accurate and relevant interventions for the clients. In this paper, the general overview of the importance of evidence-based practice will be presented. It will be followed by the discussion of the three levels of theories, including theoretical frameworks and perspectives, mid-level theories, and practice theories and models. After that, a more detailed analysis of some theory’s application in micro-and macro-practice. Finally, some concluding points and recommendations will be given in the summary.Professional Knowledge BaseProfessional knowledge is decisive for any type of work and is an obligatory requirement for a specialist in any field of activity. However, the extent, to which the intellectual abilities and expertise in the theoretical and practical aspects of the profession are important in social work, indicates the necessity to address the core elements of its knowledge base. The theoretical basis of social work practice is presented by a number of approaches, according to which one chooses a direction to the effective solution (Langer & Leitz, 2015).The work with people’s problems and needs requires critical thinking and reflection; it is complicated due to the ambiguity of the possible decisions, on which the ultimate quality of clients’ lives depends (Marlowe, Appleton, Chinnery, & Van Stratum, 2015). The link between theory and practice in social work is created by evidence-based practice (EBP).Therefore, when making a choice of the direction in which the work will be done, a social practitioner only utilizes “empirically-based treatment” that lies within the framework of EBP (Gambrill, 2007, p. 447). According to Drisco and Grady (2015), EBP is a decision-making process that requires a practitioner to “integrate the best research evidence available with their professional expertise and with client attributes, values, preferences, and circumstances” (p. 274). Moreover, the implementation of any intervention should be justified by the Code of Ethics that prioritizes the benefits of a client (Gambrill, 2007). Thus, evidence-based practice is the main direction in social work that grounds on the evidential proofs of the application of particular interventions which are validated by positive results.The multifaceted practice of a social worker is bound to intervention choice, validation, and implementation, as well as direct delivery of the services to clients. The communication with people in treatment has been documented over the years, thus creating a scope of case records, which contribute to the EBP and the ethical validations of the work (Reamer, 2005). The access to the previously obtained practical experiences of the predecessors creates a competent assessment, planning, service delivery, supervision, and accountability of the work, which are of critical importance for ethically valid social practice.According to Reamer (2005), prior documentation as an element of research provides “risk-management standards designed to enhance the delivery of services to clients and protect practitioners in case they have to defend themselves against ethics complaints” (p. 328). Therefore, theories and their practical implementation through the application of EBP construct a core professional knowledge base in social work.Primary Social Work TheoriesAny practical intervention in social service is based on a theory that predetermines the direction of thought and decision-making regarding the circumstances, values, and preferences of a client. The social work theoretical framework is divided into three levels of influence on practice, including theoretical frameworks and perspectives, mid-level theories, and practice theories and models. The first level embraces frameworks and perspectives, which are the broadest systems of ideas that shape the point of view on a particular issue.For example, a practitioner might choose a person-in-environment perspective, problem-centered practice, or strengths perspective as a general framework, within which a cease will be viewed (Langer & Leitz, 2015). Although this level of theory might be used for practice settings, it still has some limitations, including the difficulty of measurement, challenging consistent implementation, and evaluation.The second level embodies mid-level theories which are narrower than perspectives and provide an opportunity for a more specific application in a particular practice setting. These theories include crisis theory, cognitive theory, family systems theory, behaviorism, and others, which clearly define the direction in which a social worker should perform, thus providing more practical implications (Langer & Leitz, 2015). It is not difficult to define and assess the theories of this level in contrast to perspectives. However, they cannot be applied throughout practice settings.The third level of social work theories incorporates practice models, which have a direct implication on the immediate application to work. While perspectives and mid-level theories are broad guides leading to practice, models provide immediate practical directions and “offer almost a how-to manual for social workers regarding what to say and do in specified client situations” (Langer & Leitz, 2015, p. 10). Such models as solution-focused brief therapy or motivational interviewing enhance consistent practice implementation and its evaluation but can be applied only to a particular population or setting.Application of Theories to Micro PracticeSome of the overviewed theories have been applied in micro practice at the first field placement, which is Silverado Hospice in San Diego, CA. The micro practice is essential to social work and involves direct services provided for individuals and their families with regard to the particularities of a case (Austin, Anthony, Knee, & Mathias, 2016). Since the hospice is specializing in end-of-life care provision, social workers are required to apply cultural awareness, interdisciplinary knowledge, and a wide range of related skills to “address psychosocial needs of patients and their families” (Murty, Sanders, & Stensland, 2015, p. 12). The two theories that informed micro practice at Silverado include humanism theory and family systems theory.Humanism theory prioritizes the self-worth and value of the life of every person (Langer & Leitz, 2015). This theory is widely used at the Silverado hospice in the work of social practitioners with each patient individually. The communication with each client is carried out in a manner that respects an individual’s dignity and human rights. Since the facility provides care for diverse populations, the variety of services meets the needs and requirements of every client. Respectful and supporting relationships with the residents of the hospice are key to the philosophy of the organization.Families of the patients in end-of-life care units encounter significant psychological difficulties related to coping with the suffering of their loved ones and grieving after death. The task of a social worker is to address the needs of family members to eliminate adverse outcomes and foster healthy recovery after long-term treatment or loss (Curtis et al., 2016). At Silverado, family systems theory is applied in a manner that enables the inclusion of family members in the process of support in treatment according to end-of-life care. Extensive work with families allows Silverado staff to enhance the comfort of the patients, as well as provide support for the caregivers who are exposed to challenging psychological circumstances.Application of Theories to Macro PracticeSocial workers are expected to perform not only within the micro practice level but also in macro practice that incorporates activities and initiatives implemented within organizations and policies. According to Reisch (2016), the macro practice has emerged as an essential part of social work with the advances in globalization and organizational development. Therefore, it is critical for social practitioners to widen the scope of their influence and address global social issues with the help of communities and organizations. The following two theories informed macro practice at the Silverado hospice: critical theory and ecological systems theory.The leadership at Silverado cooperates with large organizations of federal and state levels to implement social change on a larger scale. According to critical theory, the social workers at Silverado carry out services for each client in accord with his or her specific requirements, needs, and expectations without any oppression or discrimination (Langer & Leitz, 2015). The participation of the hospice in inter-organizational and national programs provides an opportunity to exemplify its achievements in the field of social work for the elderly and encourage others to do the same.Ecological systems theory relates to the perception of the patterns in human behavior as a result of the influence of the environment (Langer & Leitz, 2015). Therefore, due to the fact that Silverado is often awarded for its achievements in the work with patients in end-of-life facilities, it is entitled to demonstrate its findings and practice implications. The hospice applies its achievements to change the environment to a more favorable one that enhances comfort for critically ill patients.Evaluation of ApproachIn conclusion, the professional knowledge base for social work is comprised of theories and research that form the basis for the practical implementation of service. While perspectives and mid-level theories provide broader directions for the choice of framework for future services, models supply step-by-step practical guidance for a social worker to apply in a particular setting. However, according to Adams, Matto, and LeCroy (2009), the EBP approach has its limitations related to the connection of EBP to its medical application. Also, one of the significant limitations of EBP is its high requirements for the practitioners’ skills in evidence retrieval, the development of which takes a lot of time and effort but obscures the speed of intervention implementation.The approach utilized at Silverado is beneficial due to its high level of evidential support, orientation on both micro and macro practices, as well as the aspirations to meet the needs of everyone in the diverse population. However, the scope of influence of the organization on the community and other entities could be enhanced by the application of appropriate theories. Among the recommendations for the agency, it is suggested to employ the ecological systems theory in macro practice more broadly to initiate a shift in the national policies concerning equity in end-of-life services that would allow for non-discriminative support-oriented practice that has been successfully used at Silverado."

Young people form many of their attitudes about work and careers as a result of interactions with the family. Family background provides the basis from which their career planning and decision making evolve. However, within each family, the level of involvement can vary, offering both positive and negative influences. This Digest examines the research on family influences on career development and describes implications for practice.The Influence of Family Background""Family background factors found to be associated with career development include parents' socioeconomic status (SES), their educational level, and biogenetic factors such as physical size, gender, ability, and temperament"" (Penick and Jepsen 1992, p. 208). In a study of the influences on adolescents' vocational development reported by Mortimer et al. (1992), the variable that had the most effect on educational plans and occupational aspirations was parental education.Mortimer et al. also report that parents with postsecondary education tend to pass along its importance to their children-a finding supported by other studies. Montgomery (1992) notes that females talented in math viewed their career choices as reflective of interests that stemmed from early family influence and educational opportunities. Marso and Pigge (1994) found that the presence of teachers in the family was a significant factor influencing teacher candidates' decisions to teach. DeRidder (1990), however, points out that lower levels of parent education can retard adolescents' career development.

86555549,0,"#Career Plan: Business Management -    IntroductionIn career planning there are four steps or processes that are followed. These include self-assessment where one has to evaluate themselves to find out what they want with their lives. This includes their interests, values, skills and developmental needs. Secondly one has to assess available options to ensure that they will get opportunities to practice their skills after completing their training. The third process is matching where one may identifies possible occupations and compare various alternatives. This can be done by comparing their short and long term options. Finally, one has to take action whereby they have to put into use the other three steps to make sure that achieve their set goals.BodyMy career vision is to provide efficient leadership to business people on how to manage their businesses. This means that I will make sure that I apply my knowledge and skills in advising people on how to succeed in their business. My career mission is to be the best business manager in my organization.A strong business manager should develop ethical values in order to earn credibility from their customers. This means that one has to be trustworthy and reasonable enough in order to advise people adequately. In fact, one should develop listening skills in order to allow clients adequate time to present their cases. This will guide them in making a decisive conclusion hence helping them run their businesses best.In order for one to achieve their goals they need to identify their competition. This is extremely significant because people plan on handling competition in order to achieve their goals. In fact, one should be able to carry out research on business operating environment in order to come up with strategies of achieving their goals.One has to balance their internal characteristics and external requirements in order to succeed. This is tremendously beneficial because one has to be tolerance to their competitors by practicing fair competition. This helps organization to run their operations without facing conflicts from other players in the business environment. In addition, one has to listen from customers in order to come up with what they want from the business firm. This means that a talented business manager should be able to prioritize issues brought about by customers and competitors, as well.Competition and cooperation plays key roles in career development. For instance, competition helps business managers to come up with best ideas to counter threats brought about by competitors. This helps them to strengthen their skills hence developing their careers. Cooperation also plays a key role in career development. This is evident because it calls for people with understanding and strong will to come together to do work.In a business management career, stakeholders may be owners of the organization. This means that a business manager should be able to relate well with owners of the organization in order to succeed in their career. In addition, customers may be stakeholders who are hugely powerful in this career. This means that their issues need to be taken carefully since they dictate the success of one’s career.Depending on the current progress, I feel that I am a future strategic leader. This is because I have been involved in planning for future in various organizations throughout my training. In fact, I have led various students’ organizations and together with members we succeeded in achieving our set goals.ConclusionIn any career, the concept of sustainability should not be ignored. This means that one has to practice all elements of sustainability which include conserving the environment. This makes sure that the organization works towards ensuring that they conserve what they have and protect the environment. A business manager should align all their business operations with environmental conservation principles."

The essay employs the use of several books to show what scholars think about career choices. Conversely, the essay also gives a personal opinion on industrial engineering, the career path that I have chosen.A career path is mostly a family affair. My parents indeed tried to push me towards a career path that I did not desire. Over the years, they tried to nurture me to like a certain career. Their reason for doing this was that the specific career of their choice was very promising. However, as Kane (81) explains, there is no certainty in any career. For years, I tried to please them and pretended to be excited about joining college and studying for that specific career. Finally, I decided to tell them how I felt about the whole issue. Initially, they did not understand why I wanted to do something else. However, later on, they agreed that I could do anything I wanted. Right now they support my career choices and even offer to help me further my skills and knowledge in my chosen career.On the same note, I have never been advised to chase after money and forget my dreams. As mentioned, my parents wanted me to take a different career path that they thought would make me happy. However, they did not realize that that career path was not part of my dream. I had not told them that I wanted to do something else, thus they believed that their career choice was my dream. As soon as I told them that I had a different dream, they were willing to support it. It might have taken them some time to accept that I was changing careers, but eventually, they did.Besides, I believe that I would still be happy if money was not an object. Curtis (58) explains that for one to enjoy life, they have to have and to use money. I do not dispute this. However, if money was not an object, I would spend my life teaching. I enjoy making people aware and teaching is all about making people aware. I would particularly enjoy teaching teenagers in high school. Children of this age go through a lot of emotions. They are not only growing up, but society also expects them to embrace growth, regardless of whether they like it or not. I would use several strategies to be able to help these children learn everything they can.On the other hand, given money is an object, I would enjoy working in a small company as opposed to a big one. There are several reasons for this preference. To start with, smaller companies give the workers room to grow. I want to learn everything I can about my career before I lunge into the competitive corporate world. A start-up company or a small company would be the best place to learn the ins and outs of my career. Regarding starting my own private company, I believe that the experience that I get in the small company will be very helpful. This experience will help me stay afloat when I decide to start my own company.I think that the market demand for industrial engineering is in the manufacturing industry. I still think that industrial engineering will be in high demand thirty years after graduation. However, I would add that those who advance their skills will be preferred to those who just have a bachelor’s degree. The availability of oil will make industrial engineering easier because oil is core in the industrial process. One branch of industrial engineering is operations and systems engineering. This branch would attract more students if oil became cheaper. Many industrial engineers will agree that it is the oil business that makes industrial engineering lucrative. Cheap oil would, therefore, reduce the value of the engineering course.In the same breadth, the current job market is bright. Auyang and Auyang (45) argue that many students are flocking into engineering courses. However, the world is also in need of all types of engineers, especially industrial engineers. It is important to mention that there is a risk of facing unemployment. Conversely, this risk depends on how well an individual is at their work and not because of having too many professionals. Industrial engineering is very sensitive to tech automation, new technology, competition from low-cost economics, the availability of natural resources, and the cost of energy. I will, therefore, ensure that I have all knowledge of the latest technology, economics, natural resources, and energy. Also, good knowledge in the mentioned areas will give me a competitive advantage when looking for a job.Nov (141) defines automation engineering as the creation and the application of technology in an attempt to check and control the manufacture and delivery of products. The presence of automation engineering does not, in any way, limit an industrial engineer. The two engineers can work together in various ways. One of the reasons why they can work together is that the industrial engineer can offer financial skills on a project. On the other hand, the automation engineer will suggest the technology that will be used in that project, and then the industrial engineer will use that technology to do the project. On the contrary, the creation of software that teaches how to do things that the professionals can do will threaten my future career. Nevertheless, it might take a while before this type of software is accepted in the industry.I am certainly prepared to improve on my skills to adapt to changing market forces. There are various branches in industrial engineering that one can specialize in. However, knowing more than one area will boost my chances in the job market. In the same breadth, additional skills that help in the market will also be beneficial. For example, the world of technology is changing constantly. Technology is a big part of industrial engineering. Therefore, additional skills like software engineering can be very helpful. Similarly, industrial engineering, despite being one of the longest standing engineering courses, is also changing. Therefore, continuous studying will give me an advantage and make it easier to adapt to the ever-changing market.In conclusion, I believe that career choices can be made with the help of family, but the final choice should be left to the student. However, the student should not choose a career based on how much money they will make. Such a life choice should be made based on passion and the dream of the individual involved. In the same breadth, students should always advance their skills and knowledge to adapt to the ever-changing market.Works CitedAuyang, Sunny Y. and Auyang, Sunny Y. Engineering–An Endless Frontier.

In this regard, Forney (1991) reports that, with respect to career counseling needs, college and university students often represent a distinct group. Typically, Forney (1991) states, students face a variety of changes, problems and important decisions. Their typical concerns are said to include: managing time, choosing or changing a career, developing more satisfying relationships, increasing self-awareness, building self-confidence, resolving conflict, and dealing with change. In coping with these issues, Forney (1991) reports that many students feel stressed, confused, anxious and alienated. In these instances, the career counselor will formulate both interpersonal goals, career goals, and learning goals for these individuals, focusing on methods that will reduce students ' stress and clarify their career aspirations and goals. In addition, it is noted by Forney that often one of the primary career needs of such students is to decide upon a college major.Taking a hypothetical case of a student with the characteristics and needs described above, what a career counseling might do is first test the student for career interests, aptitudes and skills. Following this, intervention efforts would be formulated. Given the specific situation, these goals would be to increase the student 's self-awareness, self-knowledge, and self-efficacy as a"
c7021ed2,0,"#The Opportunity Costs of Studying -   Case Study ExampleWhat are the opportunity costs of being a student in higher education?Costs of higher educationThe costs of food are not included because inspire of the choice made, it is a necessary expense that is incurred. If an individual decides to join college, they will spend money on food. On the other hand, if they choose not to g to college, they will still spend money on food. Therefore, the cost of food cannot be considered as an opportunity cost. Similarly, clothing cannot be included in the equation because both choices will entail spending money on clothing. Clothing and food costs are not sacrifices that an individual makes when they decide to either attend or not attend college (McMahon 63).The benefits of higher education include:Preparation for a career of choice.Opportunity to improve the standards of living.Possessions of skills and knowledge necessary to pursue desired careers and professions, as well as navigate life. In addition to academic knowledge, students gain social knowledge and skills that help them in creating collaborative relationships outside of school (McMahon 71).Economic empowerment in the form of income, wages, and salaries. Research has shown that an individual’s income is directly proportional to their level of education.Enhanced decision-making capabilities. Graduates gain knowledge and experience that allows them to make healthy decisions that benefit them and society.High standards of living with regard to economic and physical well being (Vedder par. 4).Personal development: enhanced critical thinking skills, better communication skills, a greater sense of discipline, the realization of passions, and a sense of accomplishment (McMahon 76).The opportunity cost to the individual and society is dissimilar because of the varied benefits the individual and society reap from higher education. For example, the benefits that an individual gets include personal development, a career of choice, an income, and acquisition of specific knowledge and skills that are important in life (Schierenbeck 93). On the other hand, the benefits of higher education to society include lower rates of crime, social cohesion, political stability, social capital, and enhanced social mobility. Societal economic benefits include increased tax revenues, labour market flexibility, and increased innovation (Toutkoushian and Paulsen 63). As a result, individuals enjoy higher earnings, low rates of unemployment, higher productivity, and greater life satisfaction.Works CitedGoastellec, Gaele, and France Picard.

fecd97ae,1,"#Parent Purchase Bottled Water -    For the longest time I can remember, you have always worked hard to fend for our family. I remember the time you spent on the golf course in 100oF and the sun shining on your face. When I was young, I always wondered what kept your body active and strong in the hot burning sun. This question stuck in my mind for many years until I finally realized that it was water that kept you energetic.On your left hand, you always carry Nestle bottled water and whenever it runs out you would go back into the golf cart and grab some more. Without water, I am positively sure that you will get dehydrated by the time you finish work. With all the sweat and tears, I can feel that you must be really tired with all the work that you do. Mom always says you spend too many hours working on that golf course; drawing and hoping that this course will turn out to be challenging and liked by other golfers.I remember you telling me that passion is all that one needs to succeed in any undertaking but I was too young to understand what you meant then. It was not until I got to college that I understood what you meant. Last summer, spending time with you at the golf course was amazing. I learned so much from you and from your co-workers but one thing I disliked is that being a golf course designer requires that you stay in the sun for too long.I almost fainted last summer while walking at the golf course with you but luckily your water was there to save me. There is also something that I noticed from you. You drink a lot of water! Every ten to twenty minutes you would stop at the kiosk and purchase bottled water. Sometimes, you stored too much in your golf cart, and in a day you finished around seven bottled water. By the time you finished a course, you probably consumed 2,555 bottled waters per year!Think about it! There are 365 days per year and every day, at the golf course, you consumed approximately about 7 bottles of water. That means you take 2,555 bottles of water in a year. This total number of bottled water consumed excludes the water that you take away from the golf course.Thus you not only 2,555 bottles of water but you spent about 38,325 baht which is about $1,282. You always said that money does not fall down from the sky? Also, we always have to be cautious with what we are spending our money on because money is hard to find and your “to-do list” for this year said you want to try to save more money. Dad, I think I can help you save $1,282 this year and the following year.Seattle University has offered me many opportunities to learn new things and make a difference. Currently, I am taking Environmental Ethics 481 with Professor Boyle and last week in class we watched a film called, Flow. After watching this film, I am more concerned with the lack of clean water than global warming. One of the statistics that struck me is that of the 6 billion people on earth, 1.1 billion do not have access to safe, clean drinking water (Flow 1).Now, when I purchased bottled water at a convenience store I always think of those people who do not have access to clean drinking water. Bear in mind that, studies have shown that tap water is cleaner than bottled water. With this revelation, therefore, you have no business buying bottled water.According to “Environment; Green Bottles Offer an Environmentally Friendly Alternative to Traditional Plastic Bottles” plastic water bottles contain Bisphenol A, a BPA that causes a variety of health problems (13). It takes around 1,000 years for plastic water bottles to decay, and a few bottles are recycled. Most of the bottles are burned or buried in landfills. However, both methods of disposal result in the release of toxins such as dioxins into the environment.Because dioxins may harm our health, I suggest that you stop buying plastic water bottles. I know it is hard for you to immediately stop purchasing bottled water but bottled water has been found to be no purer than ordinary tap water (Chemistry at Duke 1). Tap water can is usually obtained from sources like groundwater, streams, or even lakes. Tap water cannot be compared to bottled water since its distributors are more concerned about its purity and they do all they can to purify it.If they found out that tap water is contaminated, public water suppliers are “required to notify citizens of the contaminant, its level in the water supply, its health effects, and measures that can be taken to prevent illness.” (Chemistry at Duke 1). Tap water is also good because it is usually purified before distribution to ensure that consumers get clean water (Bottled Water Reduction 1). Dad, I think it is so much safer, in the long run, if you start drinking tap water instead of bottled water because of the fact that it is adequately regulated. Thus my suggestion that you start taking tap water is out of my love and care for you.Bottled water not only impacts the local community but it also affects the global community mainly due to the way in which every step in its manufacturing is carried out. Its manufacture is outright exploitation of natural resources (Parag 625). Furthermore, it has been proven that water bottles do have an enormous impact to our environment and they also affect our health in a negative way (Green Bottles).According to Flow, the Coca-Cola Company has received a lot of criticism due to the negative health effects resulting from consumption of its products (8). The Coco Cola Company owns a variety of bottled water like Dasani and Nestle. They are constantly buying land around the world to open new plants and exploit water resources (Flow). Dad, if only each of us takes a positive step towards conserving the environment by avoiding environmentally unfriendly products that are not compulsory, then the world would be a better place.The impact that bottled water has on the environment should get us all worried. Recycling of plastic water bottles is normally avoided by the relevant stakeholders for a variety of reasons (Bennett 1). Thus these bottles are left to pollute our environment. Furthermore, research at the Pacific Institute shows that, its takes three times the amount of water contained inside the bottle to manufacture the plastic bottles. Dad, did you also know that the process in producing plastic bottles includes many ounces of oil?From that process, this will later on results in air pollution. Think about this dad, if air pollution increase, your golf course grass would not be as green in the near future. If you care about your golf course like you always tell me, I think it is time you might consider changing to reusable bottles.In order to save $1,282 yearly, I recommend you start considering Green Bottles. Green Bottles created by Yip Bop are environmental friendly bottles made out of stainless steel. They are suitable for every occasion. They can be used at work, during activities like travelling, hiking or even shopping (Green Bottles 13). Because you are drinking more water as part of a healthy lifestyle in order to stay energetic in the sun, Green Bottles is the one for you.Green Bottles has long life duration because they are constructed of high quality food-grade stainless steel approved by the FDA. In addition, Green Bottles come in variety of designs for all hot and cold beverages. Surprisingly, Green Bottles are suitable for hot and cold weather because they are capable of keeping cold drinks cold and keeping hot drinks hot (Green Bottles 14). They are reusable, dishwasher safe and recyclable. Perhaps, Green Bottles have a sleek and stylish look and thus they are comfortable to carry around (Green Bottles 15).The most important reason I recommend Green Bottles is because some Green Bottles have filters to purify water while you drink so it is good and safe for you. Dad, if you are interested in using Green Bottles, I will order for you online now. They are not expensive and prices vary from $2.00 to $30.00. If your colleagues are interested too, we can also order for them. Green Bottles can be purchased singly or in multi-packs. Remember, they are available in many colors like red, blue, green, silver, black, orange, and white. As for you, I think a large 40-ouce size container would suits you more since you drink lots of water. I thus strongly recommend the use of green bottles for environmental conservation and financial relief.It is important that you get clean drinking water because your health and financial welfare are of great concern to me. There are ways you can stay healthy and at the same time conserve the environment while saving. This can be achieved by changing to reusable bottles and drinking from tap water. It has been shown that sometimes bottled water may not be as clean as they are advertised. A study from Duke University has proved that bottled caps are kept in a moist environment which may lead to growth of bacteria (7).There have also been a number of incidences in which bottled water was found with contamination by consumers. You must have noticed in the course of your life that the climatic conditions are substantially changing. Our sky is getting more polluted and the seasons are no longer predictable. It therefore calls for every one of us to make efforts towards environmental conservation. The use of tap water will help you achieve this objective and you would have lived a life that cares for the generations to come.Works CitedBennet, Terri., (2010).

It was filmed in the USA. It is a film based on the bottled water industry.  There are biological chemicals that can make our blue gold be just like poison.The plastic in the bottles are made of oil and can give you cancer. The water isn 't very clean and it can cause harm.  There are three main companies that sell the bad water. The three companies are Nestle, Coca-Cola, and Pepsi. 40% of bottled water is just filtered tap water. We can just filter our own water instead of spending money. Pepsi pumped 400,000 gallons of water per day when 35 states were in drought.

4d0be94c,1,"#Buying Bottled Water -   Internet Public LibraryThe article “Buying Bottled Water For Your Health, Stop It,” by Katie Herzong discusses the harm of buying bottled water. As mentioned in the article buying bottled water is estimated to be 2,000 times more expensive than using tap water. Not only is buying bottled water more expensive, but also bottled water produces fossil fuels within the environment that will be put into a landfill where it will not decompose. To better understand the damage Doctor Sanaz Majd examined the risks of bottle water compared to tap water. Her interest originally sparked when her twins were born premature, and the doctor informed her that she should avoid mixing formula with bottle water. The FDA regulates bottle water and the EPA regulates tap water. Also, the EPA has more strict standards and requirements compared to the FDA. The EPA is required to disclose the quality of public water, but…show more content…I find it surprising that much of the population continues to purchase bottle water despite the cost and being aware of the harmfulness. My only argument for why people continue to buy bottled water is because of the convenience factor. When out in public sometimes it is easier to purchase a bottle of water. Simply carrying renewable water bottle and refilling it can be an easy fix to the problem. I am guilty of being out in public and not seeing a water fountain and buying a bottle of water. Although, for the most part I try to limit my purchasing of bottled water and instead use my renewable water bottle. It seems silly to buy water when you have access to it for free. A 24-count of Nestle Waters from Walmart is $6.99, and buying a renewable water bottle costs $3.60 from Walmart. Buying a renewable water bottle is practically half the price of buying a case of water bottles. If price is not helping to eliminate the pollution of plastic water bottles there must be other useful ways"
b0ea8202,1,"#Is Tap Water Better and Safer for People and the Environment Than Bottled Water? -    Every day we make choices about what we consume, some good and bad choices. Sometimes we consider how our choices affect the environment, but sadly sometimes, we do not. In this study, I have decided to explore if tap water is better and safer for people and the environment than bottled one. I choose this topic because I have seen a video by “Behind the News,” which shows how much plastic is now in the ocean and how it is damaging our planet (Behind the News, 2016). Firstly, I am going to research various opinions on the matter from a number of sources. Further, I will look at the impact of bottled water on people and the environment. After considering all of the above, I will draw my own conclusion.In terms of environmental impact, bottled water clearly has a number of negative impacts. The study by Villanueva et al. (2021) found that if every resident of the Spanish capital switched to bottled water, it could lead to the extinction of 1.43 species of animals annually and would cost the environment 3,500 times more than if the entire city drank tap water instead (Villanueva et al., 2021). Moreover, concerns related to the health effects of drinking tap water seem to be overestimated. Brodwin and Woodward (2019) refer to several experimental studies conducted in the U.S. that often bottled water is far from being better in quality. In fact, “almost half of the bottled water is derived from the tap, though it may be further processed or tested” (Brodwin & Woodward, 2019). The disgust for tap water was most likely artificially caused by the manufacturers of bottled drinks (Hawkins, 2017). Therefore, drinking tap water is an environmentally friendly choice not associated with health-related consequences.However, some people rightfully argue that the quality of tap water in some areas and regions can differ significantly and, thus, can potentially be harmful. For example, in Mexico, the allowed limit of arsenic in tap water is 2.5 times higher than the one set by WHO (Yetman, 2021). Furthermore, some rural American regions still get contaminated tap water because it runs through systems that violate health standards (Langin, 2018). This kind of information generates controversies with what has been discussed before and makes one doubt the reliance on tap water.Nonetheless, considering different points of view and perspectives, one could draw several crucial conclusions. First of all, undeniably, tap water is much better and dramatically reduces a person’s carbon footprint from an environmental point of view. Secondly, it is at least evident that in many developed countries, there is no need for bottled water because, in general, the sanitary services cope with the regulation of the water quality at the tap. Uncertainty arises only when dealing with the problem of the quality of water in underdeveloped or developing countries or specific regions of industrialized states. The solution here is quite simple: the contamination can be determined before using tap water. Thus, one could avoid spending money on unnecessary and harmful plastic."
c27ba6f8,1,"#Bottled Water In The 1800s -   Internet Public LibraryThe recent trend of Americans carrying bottled water can be explained by its convenience, as it can be purchased in vending machines and grocery stores, and is a healthier choice than soda. In addition, carrying bottled water is a good idea to maintain one’s hydration throughout the day (“Tap Water or Bottled?,” 2006). Although dehydration, or loss of water from the body, is not a concern for many Americans, people who exercise without drinking, sick children and the elderly are susceptible to its effects. Affected individuals will experience thirst, headache, fatigue, and dizziness. In addition, if exercise is undertaken under conditions of dehydration a person may experience muscle cramp or ache (“The ‘8 glasses per day’ rule,” 2006).But"

The first is time life. Arranging a reasonable time for the job is very important. However to achieve success in your career; you'll spend almost all your time on the job. You use your whole day in the research planning implementing plans to achieve the goals already set. When startinga new job to create a good impression with your boss, to get everyone's attention, you must express yourself more than other. You must be hang person in work. You care about your job, you spend more time on it, you'll go to word earlier than everyone, and when to workload its too much, that you had not done enough to in the day. you are willing to work overtime to complete them. That efforts will be more successful for you.Every year you have about 100 days-off. They include of weekend, vacation,..althought they are days-off, you still have to work hard while people are using to their time to going to cinema, going shopping with family, friend or simply resting at home, you are working as a workaholic. While people breathing fresh air, chatting with friends,laughing loudly ...; you are busy with a lot of papers and plans ... after all. You take sometime to rest after the plan was completed, to relieve stress and create the excitement to work for the next step.To success in your career, you can sacrifice their family. You work day and night even in days-off. You don’t have must time for your family. It consumes most of the time of career of you and only afford them a very minimum time for your family. All members don’t have dinner together because you go home late or don’t have much time take care them. When your family have some problems that important, you can’t go home immediately to resolve thet problem because you are very busy in office. When relatives visit, you can’t welcome a warm although you want to invite them to stay in your home for several days. Each person has the prionty in life and each person should decide which prioritize what to do.

The logic is simple: If you do an average job and save some money, you will earn an average income. If you do an extraordinary job by spending some of your money, you can earn an extraordinary income.Not only money, when you want to really succeed, you have to give up your pleasure. Why? Because if you want to do both, you will be distracted and unfocused. Only you give up it, you can put all your mind and energy on the job you are pursuing. And ability to succeed will be higher.

80ee9cbf,1,"#The Issue of Bottled Water Consumption -   Literature Review ExampleIntroductionThe consumption of bottled water around the world is rising by about 10% annually with the United States accounting for the largest market (Gleick, 2010). For instance, in 2008, an estimated 8.6 billion gallons of bottled water were consumed in the United States alone (Zhihua, Morton, & Mahler, 2011). There is a common belief that bottled water is safer to drink and tastes better when compared to tap water.However, scientific evidence from several research studies indicates that the belief is necessarily not true. Additionally, a number of studies have shown evidence that the consumption and sale of bottled water results into a variety of social, environmental and health effects.The steady rise in the demand for bottled water is causing hips of unnecessary garbage and resulting in the consumption of vast quantities of energy according to the report by Earth Policy Institute (Zhihua, Morton, & Mahler, 2011). Nearly all countries, including Canada, have policies that govern the quality measures required in the production and distribution of tap water.However, most countries have less, if any, such policies that stipulate quality requirements in the production and distribution of bottled water (Petraccia, Liberati, Mascuillo, & Grassi, 2005). Many analysts have observed that bottled water does not really solve the problem of clean and affordable water that is essential for communities around the world.Problem StatementThere is a growing perception that bottled water is better than tap water in terms of taste and quality. Therefore more and more people are turning to bottled water in their endeavor to such for safe drinking water. However, several studies conducted in this area confirm that tap water is in fact better than bottled water.This observation is partly attributed to the more established policy framework that directs the processing and distribution of tap water in many countries around the world. Additionally, consumption of bottled water results into environmental pollution through various ways that have been discussed in the literature review below. Thus, the study will seek to determine the scenario at the University Of British Columbia (UBC).Literature ReviewAccording to recent statistics there are currently about 1.1 billion people around the world that have no access to safe drinking water (Zhihua, Morton, & Mahler, 2011). In order to halve this population by 2015, members of the UN require approximately $15 billion every year. This amount might seem large but it’s minimal compared to the estimated $ 100 billion that is spent on bottled water annually (Gleick, 2010).Tap water is processed and distributed in an energy efficient manner while bottled water is transported over long distances, usually across nations via air, road and sea (Petraccia, Liberati, Mascuillo, & Grassi, 2005). This involves the use of large quantities of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are also consumed in the packaging process.Most of the bottles used for water packaging are made from polyethylene terephthalate, a plastic developed from crude oil (Ikem, Odueyungbo, Egiebor, & Nyavor, 2001). The amount of crude oil used to manufacture water bottles in Canada can be used to fuel up to 50,000 Canadian cars annually.Statistics indicate that about 90% of the water bottles become litter or garbage after being used. Incineration of such used water bottles results in the production of toxic byproducts such as chlorine gas and ash containing heavy metals that can affect the health of both humans and animals (Ikem, Odueyungbo, Egiebor, & Nyavor, 2001).Burying the water bottles does not provide a viable solution as the bottles would require up to 1000 years to biodegrade. Waste bottles are sometimes exported for recycling in other countries such as China and therefore accounting for further fuel consumption.There are various socio economic factors that affect the consumption bottled and tap water, particularly given fact that bottled water is more expensive (Zhihua, Morton, & Mahler, 2011). Some studies have shown that gender and educational differences play a role in the preference of bottled over tap water because of their differences in the perception of environmental risk."
c7f91d69,1,"#Bottled Water Persuasive Speech -   Internet Public LibraryIntroductionMany people believe that bottled water is more preferred because it´s easier to use, it´s easier to get, and because in cases like natural disasters, it can sometimes be the only option for water to stay hydrated. But this is completely misleading, because bottled water is just more of a job for people, and the environment. Which is why bottled water is a deceitful way of getting water, because it cost more, it is causing pollution and toxins that are a safety concern, and most of all, because when you think about it, it is a completely illogical, which is why it should be banned from North Shore Middle and Entrepreneurial school. Save moneyPeople who have bought plastic water bottles think that they don't cost as much, and…show more content…This is concerning, because according Gavin Newsom, ¨over one billion plastic water bottles end up in California's landfills each year, to degrade, and leak toxic additives into the ground.¨ He also goes to say that, ¨all of this waste and pollution are generated by a product that by objective standards, is inferior.¨ Additionally, ¨only 14% of single serving plastic water bottles are recycled, that means that 86% of them are wasted.¨ Says Jennifer Glitz, a research director for the container recycling…show more content…I believe bottled water doesn't make you any more special then the next person, but it seems as if we are tricked into believing that it does make you more special, when really, it doesn't make a difference. In other words, as Elena Conis puts it, Bottled and Tap water come from essentially the same sources: lakes, springs and aquifers.¨ Not only that, but ¨bottled water isn't any safer or purer than what comes out of tap.¨ Quotes Dr. Sarah Janssen, an extensive research scientist from the Natural Resources Defense Council. Why these two things are key to note is that, it directly tells us with extensive research that bottled water not only comes from the same place as tap, but also that bottled isn´t anymore safer or purer than tap, which shows that they are essentially the same thing, which is why we should altogether banned them from our school and use reusable"

In the past, people have believed that bottled water is superior to tap water and the research will provide evidence to support or oppose this claim. The study will determine the overall effects of bottled water and the results obtained will determine whether people should be encouraged or discouraged from consuming it (Senior & Dege, 2005).The research will also be important in the implementation of other policies. Examples are the policies to do with disposal of bottles. If it is discovered that water bottles are ineffectively disposed leading to pollution, the study will assist in coming up with ways of ensuring that such pollution does not occur but instead that the bottles are recycled which will also save on resources.It is evident that the recycling of water bottles is likely to compromise on the quality of drinking water by allowing phthalate into the water. By carrying out this project, it will be possible to come up with ways of ensuring that the environment is protected while at the same time guaranteeing consumers of quality drinking water.There are a lot of fossil fuels that are required in the production of water bottler and the research will assist in finding out whether there exists more fuel saving methods of producing such bottles. There are many different issues that arise from bottled water and an analysis of all of them is important do determine the relevance of the water bottling industry in society (“Regulations of bottled water”).Areas of investigation. The project will involve an in depth analysis of various factors that have to do with drinking water. The first issue is in relation to the cultural impact of bottled water. It will examine whether bottled water is actually of superior quality to tap water as well as water from other sources. The other area of study will be to determine, from bottled water companies, the proportion of water bottles that they actually recycle.This will assist in determining the exact effect that water bottles have on the environment. A study will also be carried out on the consumers themselves to find out their attitude towards bottled water as well as whether they are aware of any differenced between tap water and bottled water. They will be interviewed on the measures that they take to ensure that their bottles do not form part of pollutants (Elmer & Tanner, 2000).Research method Primary data will be collected from companies that manufacture bottled water through interviewing various employees. Consumers of bottled water will on the other hand be provided with questionnaires to fill regarding diverse issues related to bottled water.

We all know our water supplies have been contaminated for years, but the governmental regulating bodies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration have, in the past, consistently declared that low levels of these contaminants pose little threat to us. In this article we will look at what the experts are now saying about this and how you can protect your family from danger.Past government statements concerning the health risks of contaminants such as chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceutical drugs, toxic chemicals, etc. were based on their effects on adults,…show more content…Childhood asthma, cancer, leukemia and immune disorders are on the rise. Studies suggest this is partially due to increased exposure to environmental toxins and children's decreased ability to detoxify. (The only way for the body to flush out toxins is with water and the purer the water is to start with, the better its ability to gather and flush the contaminants.)7. There are also some immediate dangers associated with drinking water for children or adults. For instance, there have been outbreaks of chlorine-resistant parasites like cryptosporidium and Giardia in city water supplies. One of the largest was in Milwaukee where over 100 people died and 400,000 became sick in less than a month. These parasites can be fatal to small children.""There's no telling precisely how many Americans get sick each year from drinking bad water...I would say that the cases we learn about are the tip of the iceberg.""

Yet, nothing is perfect no matter how hard we try. For instance, tap water can easily be found, just go straight to your kitchen sink and drink it. Easy right? This is the main reason for people to say to consume tap water rather than to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars. The con with this though is that tap water can be contaminated due to the fact that it’s coming straight from the pipes, and led could be in the water which could cause a lot"
cd0764a6,1,"#Is Bottled Water Ethical? -   Report ExampleIntroductionThe bottled water industry is one that has grown tremendously in the contemporary society, with multinational corporations such as Pepsi, Coke and Nestle earning billions of dollars in the form of returns annually from the sale of water.Bottled water is simply clean water produced either by reverse osmosis, distillation or de-ionization of regular or tap water. It can be sparkling water, which is basically carbonated water, or glacial water, which is water obtained directly from a glacier.Natural water on the other hand is obtained from a specific and recommended underground source which is not from the municipal water supply system. Mineral and spring water is from an underground source which contains relatively high amounts of dissolved mineral salts.There is also artesian water, which is water from a well that bears an underground layer of sand or preferably rocks.Bottled water has been a source of major debates and research on why citizens would prefer to spend a lot of money in purchasing something that is available for free in the society.One side of the debaters believes that the selling of bottled water is a practice that is unethical as water is freely available in the environment, and again it leads to unnecessary use of resources in packaging and distributing such water, when it can be easily fetched from the tap.A study conducted in the United States revealed that citizens of the United States consumed up to 8.45 gallons of water that has been bottled in 2009, an aspect that saw them spend $10.6 billion on the same.The interesting part was that the citizens paid 1000 more times for bottled water in comparison to the tap water cost, when most the same bottled water had been drawn from the municipal tap water.It is thus an issue of concern that the public would prefer to embrace a practice that leads to wastage of resources and imposes on them high economic costs, when they can easily obtain the commodity naturally from the environment (Gallagher 2011).Why People Have Embraced Bottled WaterThe major drive behind the high consumption of bottled water is the appeal that is created by the packaging used (Gleick 2010). Bottled water companies have embraced various advanced marketing strategies, with the major one being the use of the packaging to attract their consumers.The bottles used in packaging bottled water to always make the water to appear cooler and healthier than the tap water. However, it is evident that tap water is as safe as bottled water for consumption.Using blind taste tests, a study was conducted with the aim of differentiating between tap water and bottled water. It was identified from the study that the participants were not able to differentiate between tap water and bottled water through taste.The study reveals that there is no much difference between these two categories of water. In any case, bottle water is only but a purified version of tap water.This does not mean that tap water is not clean; the filters are only used to further clean the tap water that is already clean enough for consumption.The incorporation of beautiful images such as those of springs and mountains on the water bottles and further adding of terms such as pure on the pack creates an impression of the extra purity of the bottled water as compared to tap water.As a result, they are pushed towards preferring bottled water (Bartol et al. 2011, p. 2).Other forms of impression such as images of pregnant women consuming bottled water have also been developed in the marketing of bottled water, thus further building a perception of the water being healthier among the consumers (Natural Resources Defence Council 2013).The bottled water companies also develop terms on the packaging which define the origin of water as a place full of purity.For instance, water may be displayed as originating from the Andes, and an image of a stream emanating from the mountain is added in the package just to emphasize the purity of the water.This kind of display and the use of special terms to define the origin of water create a healthy impression of the water.Other companies also develop beautiful advertisements that are used to capture the attention of the consumers and thus to facilitate purchases of bottled water (Saylor, Prokopy & Amberg 2011, p. 589).Impact of Bottled Water on the EnvironmentThe entire process of production and distribution of bottled water has a major impact on the environment. To start with, bottled water wastes resources. Environmental degradation starts from the point of production because the amount of energy required to bottle and distribute water is high.The production process involves several processes before bottled water is ready for consumption. The biggest impact is felt in the fossil fuels. In this case, fossil fuels are used in the production process by running the machinery and in the distribution process through running the vehicles.For instance, in 2007, the bottled water industry used almost 54 million oil barrels, in the production and distribution of bottled water. The same amount of fuel can be used by 1.5 million cars in the United States for an entire year (Bartol et al. 2011).This is energy could be referred to as wasted energy given that it could be saved if individual citizens would resolve to using tap water and even carrying some in re-usable bottles.Another aspect of environmental concern in relation to bottled water is the kind of impact the non-biodegradable plastics have on the environment. Bottled water is mainly packed in plastic bottles which are made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET).Plastic bottles make up the best type of packaging since they do not easily break on impact with the floor, besides being lighter in weight. As much as some of these plastic bottles are recycled, a higher percentage of the plastic bottles are dumped into the landfills, streams, lakes, and oceans.Such plastic bottles fail to decompose, leading to the pollution of the environment (Food & Water Watch 2013).With the current rate of production of plastic bottles for packaging of bottled water and the low rate at which recycling is being embraced, it goes without saying that in the future the plastic bottles may dig into more land as they will fill up the landfills.Most bottles have also been observed to end up scattered everywhere, polluting the environment (Stephenson 2009, p. 23). These water bottles do not easily decompose and they only end up releasing toxic chemicals into the groundwater (Cheng, Shi & Adams 2010, p. 1325).By polluting the ground water, the lives that are supported by this water are thus affected. Through incineration, the plastic material release smoke that is toxic into the atmosphere. This smoke also consists of greenhouse gases that play a role in climatic changes and global warming.Ethical Issues Regarding Bottled WaterEthics in a given business or industry require that moral and ethical principles be observed. It applies to all aspects of a company’s or brand’s conduct, impacts and purposes.Functional business areas where the issues of ethics apply include a product’s environmental, financial, production, sales and marketing and human impact paradigm.In the bottled water industry, of particular interest is the issue of environmental degradation that arise from the packaging.The industry’s ethical position can also be analyzed in its impact in creating employment, companies obligations to their employees in the industry, among other concerns.The question of whether it is a healthy practice to drink water from a plastic bottle has been subjected to a lot of arguments.As much as bottled water companies exploit all the possibilities available avenues to explain the safety of bottled water, several researchers have concluded that bottled water has health effects on the users (Suzuki & Boyd 2008, p. 68).The same researchers have proven that the primary source of bottled water is the same as that of the tap water. In any case, tap water could be safer than bottled water due to the fact that the former is regulated by the strict EPA body while the latter is regulated by the more lenient FDA.The tap water is also under the management of the Municipal service, which is part of the government, and thus they ensure that they supply the public with high quality products (Ahmad & Bajahlan 2009).Of imprortance is the fact that bottled water does not provide any specific health benefits to the consumer. Municipal water in many countries is equally clean and is frequently inspected for toxic chemicals and bacteria.In the U.S. for example, safety is ensured through the close supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency.Despite the fact that safety groups point out that most municipal water systems are old and rusty, there is very little evidence suggesting that bottled water is healthier than tap water.Furthermore, the plastic container used in packaging has been noted to be in itself a risk.Bottled water companies have maintained that the plastic bottles that they use in packaging water is safe enough and that it does not expose the users to chemical pigments that could affect their health (Bartol et al. 2011, p. 3).However, according to studies carried out by the government of the United States and other independent researchers, the main plastic components, BPA, used in the production of bottles that are used in packaging of bottled water can fall into the packed water and thus be consumed by the users of the water.The chemical has adverse health effects in the body as it has been identified to mimic estrogen. Besides, the chemical; is linked to various health problems such as heart disease, diabetes, and problems of the liver.These are chronic conditions which do not have a cure, but they can only be managed and controlled. In worst cases, these conditions can lead to death. This is an issue of ethics as the company knows that the plastic components are toxic, yet they encourage the public to use it.“”The company also exhibits a lack of ethics when they claim that what they present to the public is purer when they are aware that the water and the bottles are regulated by two different bodies” (Bartol et al. 2011, p. 3).It is also an issue of ethicality that the bottled water companies do not guarantee the safety of the bottles under different conditions of storage.For instance, in the United States, a label is placed on each bottle of water in the form of a number, one that identifies the type of the plastic material used to make the bottle (Bartol et al. 2011, p. 4).It is important to note that some plastic materials can be reused for more than one time, while others are only used once. Most of the companies that process bottled water use the type 1 water bottle, which is only meant for use once.However, the companies do not enlighten the public on the dangers of repeatedly using such bottles. They also fail to consider the conditions under which such bottles are stored before they are used, ignoring the fact that the bottles are bound to spoil while stored under given conditions.In a study conducted by Harvard University students, it was determined that the level of exposure of individuals to BPA through using bottled water is so high.In the study, 77 students were exposed to a ‘cleanup’ practice for a week, where they were given water for drinking only from stainless steel containers, in order to reduce the level at which they were exposed to BPA (Bartol et al. 2011, p. 5).In the next step, participants were handed two polycarbonate bottles. They were to use them as the drinking vessel each time they consumed cold beverages for the two weeks that followed.At the end of each of the two weeks, the urine sample of the participants was taken and the levels of BPA determined. “The results showed a sharp increase of BPA up to 69 percent after the second week, in which the participants used polycarbonate bottles” (Bartol et al. 2011, p. 5).From the studies, it was identified that the plastic bottles expose the users to BPA, and hence to the health effects that come with BPA.In the cases where small baby bottles are headed in the water in order to warm their water, there is a likelihood of the bottles further releasing BPA into the water.This is an issue of major concern when it involves infants since they are likely to be susceptible to BPA’s endocrine-disrupting potential (Chellaney 2013, p. 131).Organizational Social ResponsibilityAs much as most of the companies have shown lack of ethics in their activities, some companies have developed various activities that are aimed at protecting their consumers and also ensuring that they maintain environmental conservation.For instance, various bottled water companies have embraced recycling, with the aim of reducing the environmental impact of the plastics.Organizations such as Coca-Cola have developed marketing campaigns that have educated the public on the need to recycle the company’s bottles (Bartol et al. 2011, p. 5). The organization is aiming at reducing the amount of plastic bottles that end up in the landfills.In order to facilitate this, the company produces high quality bottles that can be reused.The International Bottled Water Association has also rallied behind bottled water companies in creating awareness among the public on the importance of recycling the plastic bottles and reducing the environmental effect of these non-biodegradable substances.In the year 2010, the bottled water was identified to contribute more than a third wastes to the stream of wastes in the United States (Shaw 2011). Thus, the bottled water companies have exhibited ethics by reducing the environmental effects of their products.However, the process of waste recycling may not be as successful as it may be depicted. A survey conducted by the Container Recycling Institute revealed that the bottled water industry still released up to 1.5 tons of wastes of plastic bottles every year.The American people buy up to 34.6 billion water bottles, with 8 out of every ten of these bottles ending up in incinerators and landfills (Bartol et al. 2011, p. 6).How to Promote RecyclingThe number of plastic bottles that go without being recycled is so large. These bottles, as earlier observed facilitate environmental degradation. Thus, proper measures should be put in place to ensure that the flow of plastic bottles into the landfills and incinerators is minimized.One of the measures that can be embraced in order to facilitate the recycling of plastic bottles is that of developing bottle deposit bills in countries that do not have such bills, while including provisions in bills that already exist in countries that have such bills (Bartol et al. 2011, p. 6).These bills would require one to pay an extra amount when purchasing beverages that have been packed in plastic bottles, and they should be refunded the extra amount when they return the bottles for recycling.In the United States, higher rates of bottle recycling have been experienced in the various countries which have bottle deposit bills.For instance, in California, 80 percent of the soda and beer containers were reported to undergo recycling after the bottle deposit bill was introduced in the state (Bartol et al. 2011, p. 6). A great reduction in the levels of waste was also registered in the state.However, these bills have been observed to fail in most settings as they are highly opposed by the beverage industries through developing public relations that are extensive, using powerful lobbyists, and engaging in campaign contributions (Bartol et al. 2011, p. 6).Companies are opposed to such a move because they are afraid it will increase their costs of doing business, consequently, reducing their sales volume, since they would have to pass on the cost to consumers.These companies also fear that possibility of such a move drawing attention towards the fact the these companies fail to meet their corporate social responsibilities by producing so much waste, which they release into the environment.The efforts that have been exhibited by various organizations in terms of reducing the amount of plastic material used in making the plastic bottles have proved to be of less worth, and thus there is a need for the companies to develop other measures that would allow them to effectively cut on environmental pollution.Benefits of RecyclingEfforts have been developed by bottled water companies towards developing recycling strategies, that are aimed at reducing the amount of waste plastic that is released into the environment and the environmental damage caused by such wastes (Bartol et al. 2011, p. 6).During the recycling process, most of the bottles are reduced into the plastic material of lower grade, which is later used to create other objects such as tires, playing equipment, and carpets.Those PET bottles are broken down using chemicals, and then they are later sorted into various colors, crushed, cleaned, and cut into small pieces that are pressed into bales.These flakes are later twirled into thread and yarn. What comes out of this process, usually threads, can be, together with other fibers, be used to make other material and different fabrics.These fabrics and material can be used to create other durable and strong items such as coats, jackets, hats, bags and shoes.ConclusionThe bottled water industry is one of the fastest growing, and one that attracts an equal measure of criticism and appreciation at the same time. As explained in the paper, ethics in a given business or industry require that moral and ethical principles be observed.It applies to all aspects of a company’s or brand’s conduct, impacts and purposes. Functional business areas where the issues of ethics apply include a product’s environmental, financial, production, sales and marketing and human impact paradigm.For example, if the production process of a product risks the lives of employes, employers and the community around, ethical obligations are considered to be violated. In the bottled water industry, of particular interest is the issue of environmental degradation that arise from the packaging.The industry’s ethical position can also be analyzed in its impact in creating employment, companies obligations to their employees in the industry, among other concerns.It is evident that bottled water has penetrated its roots deep into the society, which individuals spending large amounts of money purchasing this kind of water, while disregarding the same source of such water, tap water, with is naturally available and for free.It had been observed that the water companies have created attractive images and terms that are incorporated on the packages, which create an impression of how healthy and cool such water is, as compared to the tap water.As a result, most individuals have been pulled towards bottled water not knowing the various health problems that they are exposing themselves to.The plastic bottles mainly used to pack bottled water consists of BPA chemical, which may leak into the water and cause the health effects such as diabetes, liver problems and heart attacks to individuals, if they consume such water.Various companies have developed recycling frameworks whereby they recycle the plastic bottles and they come up with other objects. This is important as it reduces the environmental effects that come with the plastic bottles for packing water.These bottles have been observed to leak chemicals into groundwater and to emit dangerous gases into the atmosphere when incinerated (Cheng, Shi & Adams 2010, p. 1325).As much as recycling stands out to be the most effective method of handling these negative effects to the environment, it has not been adequately embraced, and thus, proper measures need to be put in place in order to promote recycling.One of these measures involves the development of bottle deposit bills.Reference ListAhmad, M & Bajahlan, AS 2009, ‘Quality Comparison of tap water vs. Bottled water in the Industrial City of Yanbu (Saudi Arabia)’, Environmental Monitoring Assessment, vol 159, pp. 1-14.Bartol, D, Canney, J, Cunningham, J, Flaherty, S & McNamee, L 2011, ‘Marketing of Bottled Water: Business and Ethical Issues’, Rivier Academic Journal, vol 7, no. 1, pp. 1-8.Chellaney, B 2013, Water, Peace, and War: Confronting the Global Water Crisis, 1st edn, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc, Boulevard.Cheng, X, Shi, H & Adams, CD 2010, ‘Assessment of metal contaminations leaching out from recycling plastic bottles upon treatments’, Environmental Science & Pollution Resources, vol 17, pp. 1323–1330.Food & Water Watch 2013, Bottled Water Costs Consumers and the Environment.

Bottled water has become a huge business in the last 3 decades. The first televised commercial for bottled water was in 1977, promoting a product called Perrier. This brand of water because a symbol of purity and health. In 1979, Johanna Raymond, a runner in the 1979 New York City marathon, told New York Times, ""Perrier was the coolest thing, its way more than just water.""  Bottled water is defined as, drinking water packaged in plastic or glass water bottles. Bottled water may be carbonated or not. On the other hand, tap water is water from a piped supply. Supporters and advocates of bottled water claim that its healthier and more convenient than tap water. Although,"
b8b3dd16,1,"#The Evaluate the Popularity of Bottled Water Over the Tap Water -   Report ExampleIntroductionAll over the world water (H2O) is viewed as the source of life, it is articulated that it is the most profuse multifaceted in the earth surface. It is estimated that water covers up 70% of the earth surface. Water is a vibrant symmetry which requires an average pressure and temperature state of gas and liquid which is composed of oxygen and hydrogen. Water is usually characterized in three states liquid, solid (ice) and invisible water (vapor). Water is acclaimed to be the source of life for all living things (Petraccia, 2002).The human body is accounted to hold about 55-78% of water. However, this accountability depends on the size of the body that is in subject. To avoid dehydration the body system of a healthy human being requires about 2-7 liters of water on a daily basis. Also to account for the exact amount that the body requires is determined by other natural activities such as sickness, temperature and humidity. Although there is no set record of how much water should be drunk by a healthy person, doctors articulate that about 6-8 glasses of water daily which are equivalent to one liter of water should be drunk daily.Nowadays, companies have formed and merged in carbonizing, adding sweeteners and many other stuff to water, this water is packed in bottles and are sold a price relatively higher that the tap water (Kem Et al. 2001). However, some of water are processed through various means like reverse osmosis or distillation while others are carbonated, most of the bottled water are generally tap water or ground water. Globally it is evaluated that bottled water is evaluated at $1.6 billion with an increment of 61% from the year 2006 when it is gained momentum. There is basically no added value to the bottled water only that it is considered economical because one can carry around. However, there are many risk factors associated with bottled water although the same applies to tap water. This assignment is going to evaluate the popularity of bottled water over the tap water.AbstractWater is essential and it supports life, however whether taken in a bottle or straight from the tap makes no big of an issue. However, due to the advancement in technology and the trends adapted by human being that bottled water is safe and due to fashion incentives that carrying a bottle of drinking water is considered fashionable (Debenedetti & Stanley 2001).The acquisition that was carried out in the university to evaluate why college student prefer bottled water over tap water. The hypothesis revealed that the majority of the student all acclaimed that the issue of concern underlies in the safety of the drinking water, the contamination issue become the order of the day. Another issue that not many actually acknowledged though it was analyzed through observation is the fashion issue this is because there has been creation of fancy drinking bottles carried around by students. The analysis revealed that most of the student preferred bottled water over tap water due to health hazards.MethodologyRecently I conducted a research survey which was aimed at acknowledging which is the most preferred drinking water between tap water and bottled water. A random sample of 50 international students was picked. The instrument used by the survey was Questionnaires as the only primary method to collect data from the student participating in the research.The questionnaires were divided into two parts and had nine questions with multiple questions. The first part was about personal details, and consisted of only two questions which had multiple choice answers. The second part was about background questions, consisting of various multiple questions each having own number of choices. The second question in this section was about the preferred choice of water. The third question consists of the type of preferred bottled water. The fourth question asked about the reason why bottled water is the preferred choice. The fifth question consisted of the amount of money that the student used consumption of water weekly. The sixth question constituted of the liters of tap water consumed by the students and lastly the seven question the liters of bottled water that the student consumed in a day.Use of questionnaires was more reliable as the data to be collected was in a standard format for answering. It is also simple and quick to use if respondent understand what is required of them, data analysis from this tool is easy especially with the close ended questions type.However there were little setback of the method of using questionnaires which included; lack validity, the tool is subject to high non response rates. In addition, there is the risk of forgetting events as some took place in the past, respondents may answer superficially especially if it takes long to complete the questionnaires (Barber, 1998). All these problems I handled by ensuring that the questionnaire had no many questions, the space for provision of response was enough not too small nor big, I further explain to respondent how important their opinion are and how they stand to benefit from the study.ResultsThe number of the interviewees that responded to the research was 50. From the interviewee who responded 56% of them were females and the male were 44%. Most of the students that were accumulated in the research were mostly of international student mostly of Asian origin that formed a majority of 87% of the whole group, and the others like Middle East 16% Africa, Europe and Australia all accounted for 1%. The age differences accumulated to most of the student interviewed of age 21-25 years accounted for 50%, 16-20years accounted for 22%, 26-30 years accounted for 20% and over 30 years accounted for 8%.The bar graph accounts how the student responded on which water they favored most, 70% of the student preferred drinking bottled water and 29% preferred tap water.This graph indicates the kind of bottled water that the student preferred. 62% of the student preferred mineral water, 22% preferred spring water, 8% preferred table water and 4% preferred carbonated water (fizzy) and also a same percentage was the number of the student that preferred none of the bottled brand.This graph represents the reason that most of the student gave for preferring bottled water was accounted as 54% accounted due to health related issues, 36% due to convenience, 32 preferred due to taste, 12% preferred due to price being cheap, 4% preferred because of the brand and 1% had no apparent reason.The graph has the graphical presentation of the amount of money that the student uses on water consumption per week. The result indicated that majority of the student about 24 in total uses less than $7, 15 student uses about $7 to$14, 11 students uses more than $14 on bottled water.This graph represents the number of liters that the students partake of bottled and tap water. The figures indicates that 17 students consumes less than 1 liter, 25 student from 1 to 2 liters, 6 students from 2 to 3 liters and 2 student accounted for consumption of more than 3 liters of tap water daily. The number of liters of bottled water consumed by the student was accounted for like; Less than 1 liter 25 students, from 1 to 2 liters 16 student, from 2 to 3 liters 6 students and more than 3 liters 3 students.DiscussionThe results showed that the fundamentals aspects that drive the student into the habit of consuming bottled water more that tap water. The issue that most of the interviewee all agreed on is that they have no trust with the tap water and many avoid it due to contamination issues. The contamination issue was the most feared aspect as many articulated that bottled water has passed through all health checks before they are retailed (Lalumandier & Ayers, 2000). This brought faith and reassurance that the water in the bottle is safe than the water offered by the faculty or any residential place. The student said that because some of the faculty structures are of ages, so are the pipes that supply water in the faculty, and the way the water is supplied with some pipes being buried under ground which makes it difficult to be serviced made the matter even worse (Gleick 1999).Convenience of the bottled water as many articulated that the bottled water is available on every vendor around the corner, and that it is portable and one can move around with the container not having to drink all in once as in the tap water (Lamoreaux & Tanner, 2001). When the issue of finance was evaluated not many were concerned that they were spending more buying water which the faculty provides under the tutorial fee that they pay, the student interviewed confined that it is better to spend on buying hygienic water other than spending the money on hospital bills due to contamination water related issues.ConclusionThe hypothesis applied to the interviewees added that most of the students within the college level drink bottled water than tap water. This is due to health related concerns (Petraccia, 2002). The major concerns that most of nearly all the interviewees confined in, is the contamination issue. This shows that people are prone to believe that because of the top and seal the content inside the bottle is safe and has not effect on the human health. Fashion and convenience also compliments the popularity scale of bottled water more than the tap water."

The majority of people assume bottled water is superior to tap water. One possible reason people are attracted to bottled water is bottled water companies have fancy labels promising the purest and freshest water. Some people deem drinking bottled water to be sophisticated. However, at what cost will people sacrifice their financial security, environmental condition, and health? One of the many benefits of tap water is it is extremely cheap, in particular when compared to bottled water. The cost of bottled water is 500-2,000 times more than tap water. “Drinking 64 ounces per day of bottled water could cost well over $1,000 per year. Those same 64 ounces per day in tap water would cost less than fifty cents for the whole year!” (Bottled Water and Water Conservation). One of the reasons bottled water costs more is the customer is also paying for the bottle,…show more content…Those people have no substantial proof. Many companies use polyethylene terephthalate in their bottles. If reused or stored in a susceptible environment, bacteria can form in the bottles and other types of chemicals can be absorbed in the bottles. The plastic water bottles “can leach chemicals such as DEHA, a possible human carcinogen, and benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), a potential hormone disruptor.” (Dell’Amore and Barclay). Eliminating the plastic bottle will protect humans against these toxic chemicals. Tap water has substantial evidence to support it. Tap water is less susceptible to the effects of toxic chemicals than bottled water and overall superior to bottled water. Drinking tap water instead of bottled water has many environmental advantages. Safety is the principle concern when debating this topic, especially when people think about their families’ well-being.  Tap water is the champion of the two"

Commercials are meant to mislead consumers to steer away from tap water. They use words like “pure” that imply tap water was impure. An example of a water bottle company that misleads its consumers is Dasani. It’s packaging has images of mountains when in fact Dasani water comes from various municipal tap waters. What comes out of your tap depends on where you live in the world. Test comparing U.S. tap water to 103 different bottled water companies concluded that there is no certainty that bottled water is any safer than tap water. Tap water in the U.S is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency while bottled water is regulated by the Food and Drug administration. The Environmental Protection Agency or EPA has tougher reporting standards than the Food and Drug Administration. So despite the money spent by big companies to convince people that bottled water is better tap water may in fact be higher quality than the bottled water. It seems as though what the public does not know is that  half of all bottled water comes from tap water. Peter Gleick president of the Pacific Institute states that about 55% of water from plastic water bottles come from Springs and Deltas the remaining 45 % are from tap and other municipal sources, 18 % of bottled water brands give no information as to where their bottled water comes"
7965c0b5,1,"#Environmental impact of the life cycle of tap water with the life cycle of glass bottled waterAbstractIn this report, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology is applied to compare the lifecycle of tap water and bottled water using the four assessment methods. The results of inventory analysis and impact assessment shows that the tap water and glass bottled water production processes play an important role in almost all of the analysed parameters. The processes that have was examined include production and transportation, the quantification of the energy used and the potential contributions to impact categories was also evaluated.It was realised that the glass bottle water production shows a relatively higher energy requirement as well as overall higher contribution to environmental impact in Climate change, ozone layer, Exotoxicity, acidification/eutrophication, respiratory organics, respiratory inorganics, radiation, carcinogens, land use and minerals.1:IntroductionPresently, industries and businesses are assessing how their activities affect the environment due to increases environmental awareness. Also, the Society is becoming more concerned about the issues of natural resource depletion and environmental degradation and many industries have responded to this awareness by providing “sustainable” products and using “sustainable” processes. Drinking water is a basic necessity, but how can this basic need be satisfied in an environmentally friendly manner. This analysis compares the entire life cycle from the water extraction to serving it up in a glass bottle in a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).The systems that have been assessed in this study are: the production of inputs of tap water and glass bottle, transportation, energy used and the manufacturing process. This study was carried out with the use of the SimaPro 7 software for the inventory and interpretation of the analysis.Eco-indicator 99 (l) V2.02/Europe El 99 l/l was used as an assessment method in which the various materials and products are weighted with regard to the impact caused by them to the environment.2:Benefits of conducting Life Cycle Assessment* Life cycle analysis encourages a more informed and broader view of the environmental impact of a product. It helps decision-makers select the product or process that results in the least impact to the environment. This information can be used alongside other factors, such as cost and performance data to select a product or process.* LCA helps to avoids generalisations about the environmental performance of a product in isolation to its total life cycle. Rather, it openly acknowledges the assumptions made, and tests the effects of the assumptions.* LCA allows producers and consumers to compare relatively, the significance of different types of environmental impacts with caution.* LCA helps to avoid the Shifting environmental problems from one place to another; It allows a decision maker to study an entire product system thus, avoiding a sub-optimization that could result if only a single process were the focus of the study. For example, when choosing between two rival products, it may appear that product A is better for the environment because it generates less solid waste than product B. Get Help With Your EssayIf you need assistance with writing your essay, our professional essay writing service is here to help!Essay Writing ServiceHowever, after performing an LCA it might be discovered that the first product actually creates larger cradle-to-grave environmental impacts when measured across all three media i.e. air, land and water e.g. it may cause more emissions of chemicals during its manufacturing stage. Therefore, the second product that produces solid more waste may be viewed as producing less cradle-to-grave environmental harm or impact than the first technology due its lower chemical emissions.This ability to track and document shifts in environmental impacts of products can help decision makers to fully characterize the environmental trade-offs associated with product alternatives.By conducting an LCA, analysts will be able to;* Analyze the environmental trade-offs associated with one or more specific products to help gain stakeholder’s acceptance for a planned action.* Quantify the environmental emissions to air, water, and land in relation to each life cycle stage and the major contributing process.* Develop an efficient assessment of the environmental consequences associated with a given product.3:Challenges encountered in conducting Life Cycle AssessmentPerforming an LCA could be time and resource intensive. Depending on how comprehensive the user wishes to conduct, gathering the data can be problematic, and the availability of data can greatly impact on the accuracy of the final results. Therefore, it is important to consider the availability of data, the time required to accomplish the study, and the financial resources necessary against the anticipated benefits of the LCA. Table 1 below shows the general challenges of LCA.Table 1:The general challenges and difficulties of LCA methodology.Goal definition and scopingIn conducting an LCA, the cost may be prohibitive to small firms; also, the required time to conduct LCA may exceed product development constraints especially for short development cycles; the temporal and spatial magnitude of a dynamic product system are complex to address; definition of functional units for the evaluation of design alternatives can be problematic; allocation methods used in defining system boundaries have inherent weaknesses; complex products (e.g. automobiles) entails huge resources to analyse.Data collectionAvailability of data and access can be limiting e.g. proprietary data; data quality, including bias, precision completeness and accuracy ,are frequently not well addressed.Data EvaluationSophisticated models and model parameters for evaluating resource depletion, human health and ecosystem, may not be available or their ability to represent the product system may be repulsive. Thus most times, uncertainty analyses of the results are often not conducted.Information transferDesign decision-makers often lack knowledge about environmental effects, and aggregation and simplification techniques may distort results. Synthesis of environmental effect categories is limited because they are incommensurable.According to (Keoleian, 2003)”Both cost and time constraints currently limit thepractice of LCA”. Most small companies are not likely to be able to afford specializing in LCA and even for larger firms, the benefits of investment in LCA may not be apparent immediately. In some cases, possible cost savings may not be identified unless full cost accounting systems have been instituted.Therefore, in other for it to be more cost effective, it should be incorporated into the existing environmental management system and information systems within a firm.Also, LCA will not conclude on which product is the most cost effective or works the best. Therefore, the information developed in an LCA should be used as one component of a more comprehensive decision process in assessing the trade-offs with cost and performance, an example is Life Cycle Management.4:Present quality examples of uses of LCA.One example of the uses of Life cycle assessment is its application in the pulp and paper industry. Life cycle assessment is used to compare the environmental impact of the use of two kinds of fuel i.e. heavy fuel oil and natural gas, in the pulp and paper production process.Another, LCA methodology can be applied to agricultural production. An example is the Life cycle analysis of sugar beet production using different forms of nitrogen fertilizers. It could be used in this aspect to quantify and evaluate the impact of the choice of different N fertilisers on the environmental burden associated with the sugar beet production system.Also, it could be applied in the bakery industry. An example is the life cycle analysis of bread production by comparing homemade bread or industrial bread. In this context, it could be used to compare the environmental effects of producing bread at home or at the bakery showing which type of bread production has less environmental effects and how the environmental effects can be reduced.5:Guidance and LCA standardsThere are international standard which help us undertake LCAs in a standard way.The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies) and the ISO technical committees produce international standards on a variety of topics.The ISO 14000 seriesThe ISO 14000 series relates to numerous facets of environmental management. These series includes ISO 14040 – 14043 and they were prepared by the Technical Committee ISO/TC 207, Environmental Management Subcommittee SC 5, Life Cycle Assessment. While ISO recognizes that LCA is still in a growing stage of development, ISO 14040-14043 is a consensus-based, voluntary set of standards pertaining to LCA.ISO 14040 – Environmental management – Life cycle assessment – Principles and framework: Specifies the general framework, principles, and requirements for conducting and reporting life cycle assessment studies, but does not describe the life cycle assessment technique in detail.ISO 14041 – Environmental management – Life cycle assessment – Goal scope and definition and inventory analysis: Specifies the requirements and procedures for the compilation and preparation of the definition of goal and scope for an LCA and for performing, interpreting, and reporting a life cycle inventory (LCI) analysis.ISO 14042 – Environmental management – Life cycle assessment – Life cycle impact assessment: Describes and gives guidance on the general framework for the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) phase of LCA, and the key features and inherent limitations of LCIA. It specifies requirements for conducting the LCIA phase and the relationship of LCIA to other LCA phases.ISO 14043 – Environmental management – Life cycle assessment – Life cycle interpretation: Provides requirements and recommendations for conducting the life cycle interpretation in LCA or LCI studies. It does not describe specific methodologies for the life cycle interpretation phase of LCA and LCI studies.(Dooley, 2002)ISO 14040:2006 Environmental management – Life Cycle Assessment – Principles and frameworkPAS2050:2008 – Specification for the assessment of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of goods and services(Patterson, 2009)These standards set out the general process that should be followed when undertaking any Life Cycle Assessment and are not legally binding or enforceable.6:Methodological framework6.1:General requirementsThis analysis was performed using a methodological framework based on ISO (International Organization for Standardization) recommendations stated above and according to ISO, there are four phases in LCA: goal and scope definition, inventory analysis, impact assessment and interpretation.6.2:Goal and scope definition6.2.1: PurposeThe purpose of this study is the identification and assessment of the environmental impacts associated with the production, use, disposal and recycling of tap water and glass bottle water.The main reason for conducting this study is to compare the environmental impact of the life cycle of tap water with the life cycle of glass bottled water, to provide information on which of production processes has less environmental impact, to understand which of the processing stages account for the highest or lowest environmental effects and to evaluate how the environmental impacts can be reduced.6.2.2: Functional Unit (FU)The main purpose of the functional unit is to provide a reference unit to which the inventory data are normalised. In this assessment, the appropriate functional unit of water is related to 1 kg of portable water to be consumed and the equivalent amount which is 750 grams of water in the bottle6.2.3:Study QuestionsThe study seeks to answer the following questions:* What are the environmental impacts of tap water and glass bottle production?* What are the different materials used in the manufacture of these two products?* Which of the production processes has less environmental impact?6.2.4: Product descriptionThe products being assessed are glass bottle and tap water. The raw material used in the production of glass bottle are dolomite, sand, feldspar, limestone, silica sand, natural gas, 2 litres of water and electricity while the raw material used in the production of the tap water are water from lakes, water from river and underground water, chlorine, hydrogen peroxide, ozone, charcoal and electricity.6.2.5: Product system boundariesThe system being assessed produces glass bottle water and tap water using the typical life cycle stages.* Cradle to material production for glass bottle and reuse.* Treatment and distribution of tap water.6.2.6:Process flow chartsThe process flow for the glass bottle is represented in figure 1 below and it includes the following; Water, dolomite, soda, limestone, feldspar, sand, silica sand, natural gas, electricity, transport and waste disposal (land filling and recycling).Figure 3:The network of the Life cycle analysis of the glass bottled water.Figure 4:The network of the Life cycle analysis of the tap water.6.4.2:Impact Assessment of the tap water and glass bottle waterThe comparison is made up of the environmental impact of glass bottled water and tap water.For the glass bottle water, the environmental impact is also determined by the power requirements, the basic infrastructure and in this case, the waste disposal scenario is taken into consideration which involves the recycling of the glass. The power requirements and basic infrastructures includes; Electricity, soda powder at the plant, natural gas, transport, manufacturing of the empty white glass bottle and assembly of glass bottle full of water.The analysis of the inventory carried out for the tap water shows that the environmental impact of tap water is determined by power requirements and by the basic infrastructure i.e. the electricity production medium, the pump station, portable water , water supply network and supply of water.

When the values are normalized, comparison between impacts can be made. From chart 3 below, It was found that the main impact is from the assembly of glass bottle full of water. The main substances that contributed to this impact are; Carbon dioxide, fossil, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, lead, nitrogen oxides, particulates and sulphur oxide emissions that occurred during the manufacturing of the empty white glass bottle. The second impact is the waste disposal, this impact is caused during the waste scenario. The third impact being transport caused due to emission from the lorry taking the bottles to the retailer.Chart 3:The normalisation under impact assessment for the life cycle of glass bottled waterTable 6: The normalisation under impact assessment for the glass bottled water.Chart 4: The normalisation under impact assessment for the life cycle of tap waterFrom the chart 4 above, It was found that the main impact is from the supply of water.

Followed by waste disposal and transport impact.Chart 5: The weighting under impact assessment for the life cycle of glass bottled waterTable 8:The weighting under impact assessment for the glass bottled waterChart 6:The weighting under impact assessment for the life cycle of tap waterBased on table 8 below, the weighting under impact assessment for the life cycle of the tap water is given the same as the normalization. The main impact from the supply of water. The main substances that contributed to this impact are aluminium, chloride and chlorine emissions that occurred during the production of the portable water.Table 9:The weighting under impact assessment for the tap waterConclusion / RecommendationFrom the analysis conducted, tap water contributed the least damage to the environment while glass bottle contributed the highest damage to this category. However, tap water still contributed even at a moderate effect and efforts are needed based on reducing the damages that could happen.Thus, from an environmental point of view, tap water is generally preferable to glass bottled water. If, as an exception, bottled water is consumed, its production process is much more relevant for its environmental impact than its assembly.Among the impacts identified are;* The empty glass bottles production process contributes damages to the human health and the ecosystem quality.* The electricity generation process which uses natural gas has reduced the natural resource.To overcome these problems, suggestions of corrections are as follows:1. The use of plastic bottles water to replace the glass bottle water2. The reliance on natural gas for electricity generation is suggested to be combined with other two types of renewable electricity generation namely:* Using 25% solar energy (considering most manufacturing industries to divert into the use of solar energy).* Using 25% hydro-electric energy 25% considering the fact that electricity could be generated from the flowing water in the water treatment plant.* Using 50% natural gas."

9049f0ac,1,"#Motivations to Choose Bottled Water -   Report ExampleIntroductionBottled water is considered one of the fastest-selling liquid commodities on the planet today (Elmhirst, 2016). A report by DÇruiz (2015) shows that its sales numbers have outpaced those of milk, sugary soft drinks, and alcohol. The growth of the bottled water industry is attracting a lot of global attention because more companies are jostling to have a significant share of the market. However, it is difficult to attract customers who are spoilt for choice to a market that largely offers the same thing. In this paper, the motivations for choosing different bottled water brands, among a selection of companies, are highlighted. However, before delving into this matter, the section below provides a background of the bottled water industry.BackgroundThe bottled water industry is a multibillion-dollar economic sector that has taken many observers by surprise (Elmhirst, 2016). Indeed, it is ironic that a commodity, which is commonly available in many countries, could create such a lucrative industry (Elmhirst, 2016). Although few companies which sell bottled water make significant changes to this precious commodity, consumers are willing to pay a lot of money to have it. Today, it is almost impossible to find offices without bottled water dispensers and people working out without a bottle of water in their hands. In some homes, people still choose to buy the commodity despite having water flowing through their taps.Additionally, they choose to do so despite many local authorities guaranteeing that the water flowing through their taps is safe to drink. These dynamics have created an interesting, but lucrative, demand for a common commodity that many cannot do without. The sheer size of the market is more attractive to prospective companies because the market is big enough for everyone. However, the problem most companies experience is that they are all selling the same product. Therefore, the only viable platform for competing with rivals is through the adoption of successful marketing techniques. Different attributes associated with the concept (marketing) influence how consumers make their purchasing decisions. The section below highlights three key marketing attributes that influence the motivation to choose one brand of bottled water over another.MotivationsPricingPricing is considered one of the essential components of marketing. Therefore, it is not surprising that it would inform the decision-making. Consumers often prefer to buy products from companies that offer affordable bottled water to those that sell the commodity expensively. Indeed, some people say that pricing is one area of marketing bottled water where most companies choose to compete (“Companies are racing to add value to water,” 2017). Those that offer the lowest prices tend to get the largest share of the market, while companies that price their water at a premium are often confined to a niche market (“Companies are racing to add value to water,” 2017). A low price strategy is possibly beneficial to consumers in the short run, but in the long run, companies that are unable to adjust their operational costs accordingly are likely to be negatively affected by it.AdvertisementAdvertisement is often touted as an important marketing concept for different types of businesses because it always keeps customers engaged and invested in products (TMM, 2017). Additionally, it could redefine people’s perception of a product, or service, based on the kind of value customers get from it. The bottled water industry is subject to the same motions because advertisement has a huge impact on how consumers view a product. Generally, companies that advertise innovatively are likely to get more attention from customers than those that do not. Additionally, companies that are innovative in how they produce their bottled water are also likely to get more sales than those that do not do so (“Companies are racing to add value to water,” 2017). The concept of advertisement could mean different things for the bottled water industry. However, in the context of this study, this concept mostly means how companies package their products to appeal to specific market segments. Water is simply water. However, adding value to it through advertisement could mean the difference between a sale and the lack thereof.Quality/SafetyThe quality and safety of anything consumed are often of the utmost importance to consumers. Consequently, buyers are often specific about the kind of products they choose to purchase. Although the bottled water market is a highly regulated industry, companies that adhere to higher safety and quality standard are more likely to attract more consumers than those that do not (FDA, 2017). The importance of making sure only quality and safe products are bought stems from accusations that some bottled water companies are simply taking free water from the tap and selling it to customers at a profit. Some vendors are notorious for false advertisements, whereby they make claims that their water is sourced from springs, but it emerges not to be the case. These incidences draw our attention to quality and safety issues, which would otherwise inform a customer’s decision regarding which bottled water brand to buy (International Bottled Water Association, 2017). Companies that strive to maintain high quality and safety standards are likely to get higher traffic of customers than those that do not.Comparison/AnalysisAccording to this paper, advertisement, price, and the quality of bottled water influence the motivation to purchase the commodity from different companies. The quality of water processing emerges as the top reason with the highest effect on purchasing decisions because quality supersedes the most superficial aspects of marketing, such as price and innovation. Price would be the next most important issue to consider in this paper when selecting bottled water brands, followed by advertisements.The three motivating factors highlighted above fit within Philip Kotler’s model of marketing, which frames marketing concepts within 4Ps – price, product, place, and promotion (TMM, 2017). Price is highlighted in this paper as a motivating factor for selecting the most appropriate bottled water brand. It directly applies to the first “P,” which demonstrates that consumers would be partly persuaded by the price of products or services when making purchasing decisions. The quality of bottled water is also highlighted in this paper as another motivating factor for the purchase of the commodity. Kotler’s second “P” – product – represents it.According to Kotler, the nature and value of different products, or services, often dictate the appeal they will have on the market (TMM, 2017). The need for developing products and services that suit a customer’s specification is integral to this analysis because customers are generally likely to buy products that fulfill their desires (TMM, 2017). In the context of this study, products that are of high quality would have the highest appeal, partly because many people who buy bottled water are often health-conscious. Therefore, the quality of bottled water they buy often matters.Lastly, innovation is another motivating factor highlighted in this paper that influences the decision regarding which brand to buy. Innovation is covered in Kotler’s last “P” – promotion. The strategies adopted by bottled water companies to market their products would come to focus in this space because, although they are selling the same products, customers would be more attracted to advertisements or campaigns that appeal to a specific attribute they are interested in. For example, a bottled water company that has a youthful bottle design, or that markets itself as such, would find more appeal among this demographic. Similarly, a company that focuses on the functionality of its products would attract customers who are interested in the same. Based on this fact, the advertisement would be a motivating factor for people to buy a specific type of bottled water brand.Generally, the three attributes highlighted in this paper show that advertisement, price, and product quality are important motivating factors that influence the decision to purchase a specific brand of bottled water. Kotler explained these motivations in his 4Ps framework. Although the concept of “place” does not apply to this study, price, promotion, and product are explained. The main power of influence that these three influencing factors have on people’s decision to choose a bottled water brand is their appeal to people’s need to get quality products at the right price and for the right person. This core thread of analysis informs the motivation to choose the right bottle brand.According to Kotler’s 4Ps of marketing, there is no clear distinction regarding which of the four key categories of marketing is superior or more impactful in purchasing decisions. However, in this paper, price appears to have a greater significance for consumer purchasing decisions because of the uniformity of the product sold – water. If the product sold had a differentiating factor, the price would seize to have the same impact. However, this is not the case. Product quality emerges as the second most important factor that influences the motivation to buy a specific brand of water.This is because quality and safety concerns are at the top of the list of many consumers in this market segment (International Bottled Water Association, 2017). Furthermore, many customers who consume bottled water tend to be health-conscious. This is why they prefer this type of water to tap water. Advertisement is the least impactful attribute of influencing consumers to purchase bottled water because it appeals to the superficial aspects of marketing that could fail to gain traction or hold for a long period. Nonetheless, the aforementioned ranking does not take away from the fact that all the three factors highlighted have a significant impact on the motivation to choose a specific brand of bottled water.ConclusionIn this study, the peculiarities of the bottled water market are seen to have captured the attention of analysts who have expressed their amusement at the fact that a commodity, which is readily available in many homes, has evolved into a million dollar business. Companies are trying to meet the demand for this product in the ever-expanding market, regardless of the fact that they are all selling the same commodity. The future of this industry is largely dictated by the decision of consumers to buy a specific type of bottled water brand. In this paper, advertisement, price, and product quality/safety emerge as the top motivating factors that influence such a decision. Therefore, companies that want to outwit their competitors in this market need to concentrate on them."

In these three articles, the argument against disposable bottled water is posed, as it is believed that water bottles create unnecessary production costs, environmental damage, and threaten safety and health.According to Cotroneo and Gentile, bottles of water have become increasingly costly for customers to purchase and to produce and distribute by using energies such as fuel.

Despite many people opting for bottled water, the consumption of tap water remains high. As Doria (2006) notes, the type of water that a person consumes mainly depends on individual’s view and opinion about each type. However, it should be noted that most bottled water companies capitalize on the concerns that exist on the usage of water supplied by the municipality to homes through the taps. Some people feel that the…show more content…Although the packaging itself is bad enough for the bottled, (Ferrier 2001)  notes that the chemical composition of the water itself can be more deadly due to limited regulation. The tap water is under keen regulation by the municipality. Besides, (Ferrier 2001)   goes ahead to indicate that quality of water coming from the taps is checked routinely for any suspicious particles and chemicals. This is not the case for bottled water. First, as Doria (2010) notes, twenty to twenty-five percent of the bottled water comes directly from tap water without any form of purification through distillation of any other treatment. This means that 25 to 40 percent of the bottled water is not any different from the tap water only that it has been exposed to or has a high concentration of the chemicals used to manufacture the packaging plastics.  Due to the pathetically primitive regulation of the bottled water, the manufacturers are not keen to inform the consumers of the contaminants that are present in their water. According to Warburton (1993), consumers are likely to drink bottled water containing contaminants such as E.coli, asbestos, giardia, bromate and many other industrial chemicals and pathogens.

Besides, as indicated by Arnold & Larsen (2006), there is a general perception that the tap water goes under thorough purification before the actual packaging. Those in support of the bottled water also indicate that tap water is cheap and affordable.  Although some of these arguments are true, they cannot justify bottled water as a better option than the tap water. First, although the bottled water is available in all destination, tap water is also found in every location served by the municipality. In fact, as Arnold & Larsen (2006) indicate, most people consume the bottled water not because it is convenient, but because they believe it is safe.  As mentioned earlier, the safety of the bottled water is even questionable because of the limited regulation of the sector. In addition, even though the bottled water is economically friendly in terms of prices, the tap water is more cost"

According to Norm Schriever when the water bottles photodegrade they break down into smaller fragments which, “absorb toxins that pollute waterways, contaminate our soil, and sicken animals (which we then eat).” These bottles people buy are killing our environment every day whether we want to believe it or not. This does not include all the plastics floating in the ocean like huge islands bigger than the size of Texas. More than 80% of the bottles people buy end up in landfills and in oceans causing major damage to the ecosystem and harming many of the creatures around those areas. If we just either recycle those bottles or not buy them in general, we can improve our environment more each"

The shelf life of bottled water is extensive, especially compared to tap water. When talking about its advantages in countries or places with poor water resources, its portability is an advantage also in this instance, it allows countries where clean water is not accessible, bottled water allows the people of these countries the opportunity to protect themselves from the diseases that linger in the contaminated water. The diseases people encounter often make them extremely ill and at times they don’t survive. Bottled water's high reputation, and standards for cleanliness grant third world countries the chance to attempt to protect their citizens. Nevertheless, bottled water also comes in high demand when a natural disaster occurs. There may come a time after a natural disaster where many locations may not be able to receive clean water for a period. Bottled water is portable, safe, and easily obtained here in the United"
8312d6fa,1,"#Persuasive Essay On Tap Water -   Internet Public LibraryWe have been engaged by Sydney Water to convince a target audience to drink tap water rather than purchasing bottled water. We have targeted teenagers as they are the largest group of Australian consumers of bottled water and we believe they would be most sensitive to the benefits that come with switching to tap water. Studies show that teenager’s link bottled water with healthy living. However bottled water is not guaranteed to be any healthier than tap water. In fact, roughly 40% of bottled water begins as tap water. The only difference is added minerals that have no health benefit. In fact, the French Government has advised people who drink bottled water that the added minerals in bottled water may be dangerous in higher doses.Australians…show more content…It is removed from the ground, packaged, transported and chilled before it makes it into our fridges. This creates over 60,000 tons of greenhouses gases a year in Australia alone. Australia even imports water from overseas countries like Italy and France to satisfy the demand for so called exotic bottled water. Do you really think that’s exotic, when the transport and manufacture of all the plastic bottles uses over 460,000 barrels of oil?To further ruin our environment, less than 40% of these bottles are recycled; the balance ends up in landfill or in our waterways. The bottles used to package water take over 1,000 years to bio-degrade and if incinerated, they produce toxic fumesMany people are realising the negative effects of bottled water and returning to drinking tap water. In some places in Australia, bottled water is being banned and instead people are being asked to bring a reusable container to the tap. Some people in certain locations believe they need filtered water, and there are a host of filter jug systems available or you can get a filter fitted to your kitchen tap. Bottled water wasn’t even heard of in Australia until the late 1980s, what did we do before"

It has become part of our culture and ranges second in sales to carbonated soft drinks. Though we Americans love our bottled water, some people have questioned bottled water and think that it should be banned. This is nonsense because bottled water is an important source of hydration and we should not take it away from people. Bottled water should not be banned because in some places fresh water isn’t always available, water is essential after emergencies or natural disasters, and taking away the healthiest choice of hydration in food stores will discourage people from drinking it.

During some natural disasters the water from your tap might not be clean enough for you to drink. In every survival kit there is water, most commonly bottled water. There is also canned water and water in pouches but these are hard to open, store, drink out of, reuse, and aren’t very strong. Bottled water is the best choice because it is easy to drink out of, store, reuse, and will stay in one piece throughout the toughest storms, earthquakes, and floods.

Bottled water is important and we should definitely keep it available but people should try to use bottled water only when they absolutely have to, otherwise people should try to use reusable bottles for their water. To help minimize the use of plastic bottles, the government should put a tax on drinks that are packaged in plastic bottles so less people would use plastic bottles. The government should then use the money from the plastic bottle taxes to make reusable bottles cheaper so more people would use reusable bottles instead of plastic bottles. This is a great way of limiting the amount of plastic bottles used and thus help the environment. In the long run, bottled water is vital to us humans and undoubtedly should not be"
2fa6f12a,1,"#Environmental and Cultural Impact of Bottled Water -   Report ExampleAbstractAn entrenched belief in people’s minds that bottled water is superior to tap water has triggered a chain of environmental and cultural challenges to policy makers and environmentalists in conserving the environment and while ensuring quality water for consumers.The problem of disposing water bottles by enforcing policies for responsible waste bottle disposal, alternative forms of producing water bottles that are environmentally friendly and economically viable alternatives to justify the existence of water bottling industries in the society defines the problem statement.Specifically, the approach to solving the problem will span a careful investigation into the effects of bottled water and waste bottles in the environment, through the collection and analysis of primary data, interviewing company executives that bottle water, and analyze methods used to curb environmental pollutions. Inn conclusion, these could result in efficient approaches to waste bottle disposal, provision of clean water in harmony with environmental and cultural environment and effective policy formulation and enforcement.IntroductionMany and divergent views have been held over time by consumers of bottled water. Specifically, bottled water consumers have regarded this water as safe and of good quality for consumption. This belief has generated a chain of environmental and cultural concerns for policy makers and enforcers over the production and ineffective disposal methods.The research will focus on the impact and enforcement of disposal policies and environmental pollution, conduct an investigation into various areas, analyze different research methods, analyze research methods and draw conclusions from the study for effective approaches to environmental conservation in harmony with the cultural environment.The research will come up with strategic approaches to enforcing policies for environmental conservation, excellent and alternative methods of bottled water manufacture and better and viable alternatives for fuel saving in the production process.BodyThesis statement: Bottled water has had diverse environmental and cultural impacts spanning policy formulation and enforcement strategies. According to Hall (2007, p. 7), bottled water is a widely consumed product. This is an industry that many companies have strategically invested in. The wide usages of these products have environmental and cultural consequences that need to be addressed.According to Goodman (2009, p.3), waste bottles when ineffectively disposed of litter and lead to environmental pollution that in the end become both culturally and environmentally destructive. This concern and the approaches used to manufacture these bottles is a course for concern to the researcher. In addition to that, the quest to provide quality water and efficient manufacturing processes and policy enforcement strategies will be the basis of the research.The specific audience will span policy makers and law enforcement agencies, environmental conservation groups and agencies, manufacturing and recycling companies, water bottling companies and individual consumers.To effectively formulate and implement policies for environmental conservation, the research will analyze the impact of those policies, analyze the quality of water in these bottles, the extent to which current bottle disposal approaches have polluted the environment, analyze consumer behavior and attitudes, company manufacturing and packaging methods, and critically look at available literature spanning all aspects of culture, the environment, and water consumption (Sharfstein, 2010, p. 1).ConclusionAccording to the research proposal, an analysis of the environmental impact of disposing waste water bottles, disposal methods, manufacturing methods, policy formulation and enforcement in the manufacturing methods and use of these bottles, and the quality of water sold out to the consumer formed the backbone of the research.In addition to that, various cultural attachments and consumer attitudes besides the recycling strategies and possible alternatives or efficient recycling methods and efficient fuel usage in the whole process was a vital consideration in the research.Reference ListGoodman, S.

One of the problems with water is that people try to choose which one they would think is the most safe, but sometimes people have the wrong perspective on which water is more healthier. On one side of water, bottled water, it is used commonly throughout the world, being the second most popular commercial beverage in the United States. On the other hand, tap water is found locally in drinking fountains, but is the least favored among the people of the world. Annie Leonard’s position on bottled water through her videos and her script, “The Story of Bottled Water,” clearly demonstrate how tap water is a more viable source than bottled water. Through"
