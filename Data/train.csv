5cc22ce4,0,"#Career Development in Generation X -    Career Development in Generation XCareer Development in Generation XGeneration X refers to the population cohort following the Baby Boomers. Sources differ as to the exact years during which this cohort was born. Coupland (1991) suggests 1960 to 1970; Bradford and Raines (1992) propose 1965 to 1975; and Howe and Strauss (1993) suggest 1961 to 1981. Whatever the birth years, it is their common life experiences that give this cohort an identity. Individuals born in Generation X are reputedly more global, technologically oriented, and culturally diverse than the generations before them. Coming of age when the linear career path no longer exists, where average income is falling, and where continuous change is the norm, does this generation have different values, work ethics, and attitudes toward work and career development? As the myths and realities of this question are explored, it is important to remember that the characteristics, habits, and traits attributed to individuals in this cohort are mere generalizations, presented to afford a better understanding of the generation called Generation X.Myth: Individuals in Generation X Are Slackers,Lacking Career Drive and AmbitionVarious books, articles, and surveys have described individuals in Generation X as slackers, cynical about the future and resentful of Baby Boomers who have ""taken all the good jobs"" (Kruger 1994).

d8ddd57d,0,"#Career Decision-Making in Business Administration  IntroductionIt is important to note that identifying key issues in one’s field of interest is critical in order to be able to effectively manage and resolve them. In business administration, one of the main challenges is knowing where to apply the acquired knowledge and skills. The two major problems include deciding where to use the associate’s degree and planning when I should start my own business.Starting Business After Graduation in Business AdministrationThe first primary issue is trying to decide what I want to do with my associate’s degree when I obtain it because there are many options. A study suggests that “students do not equally value or understand the purpose of the associate’s degree” (Cortes-Lopez & Taylor, 2020, p. 61). In other words, the abundance of options is as paralyzing as the lack of them. One arguable side is deciding on a standard path of becoming an administrative assistant mainly focused on operations. Another arguable side is to go into sales, such as sales supervisor and consultant, because it can be highly lucrative if one has the necessary skills.The second major issue is deciding when to start my own business. All people studying and working in the business administration field tend to have plan to start their own businesses at some point in their careers (Boone et al., 2019). However, this requires deliberate planning ahead in the longer term since the relevant experience needs to be accumulated and funds secured. One arguable side is to do it within five years after graduation because I have the resources needed, and the failure experience will be valuable for my career. The other arguable side is postponing it and focusing solely on a career to accumulate as much experience and knowledge as possible.When it comes to deciding the future career option used for my associate’s degree, my decision lies with administrative responsibilities and operations management. The first reason for such a choice is a mere self-awareness of my strengths and weaknesses as an individual. I have a more analytical mind and operate well under conditions of precision and accuracy. Secondly, sales require a masterful ability to interact with customers, which mandates the presence of human skills, such as being an effective communicator. Therefore, opting for administrative positions might have a better use for my skills and knowledge and my limited experience. However, it is critical to be flexible and adaptable to new pursuits, which is why I am not fully rejecting the alternative. I do not know whether I would enjoy sales since I did not work in the field. Thus, realistically I will go for administrative career paths but will be open to new opportunities offered by my associate’s degree.ConclusionIn conclusion, I decided to postpone starting my own business even if I am fortunate enough to have access to the resource to start the business with some degree of safety. The decision is based on a lack of experience and competence. It would be better to acquire the latter needs in a safe and reliable environment of employment. The availability of an opportunity does not necessarily mandate reckless use of it. Therefore, I will focus on growing and developing my career of choice. My topic is important and meaningful because it showcases the criticality of long-term planning and self-awareness of one’s limitations and strengths.",1
878f041c,0,"#What Are the Career Doldrums? -    What Are the Career Doldrums?What Are the Career Doldrums?The notion of the career doldrums is not a new one. Individuals have suffered from the symptoms associated with this concept for as long as jobs and careers have existed. What is new is the more open acknowledgment of the phenomenon. Judith Waterman, a career counselor in San Mateo, California, has seen her client base change significantly during the last 20 years. After beginning with reentry women in the 1970s, Waterman reports that ""during the 1980s, [she] was seeing high achievers who were thinking, 'How did I get here and why am I not happy?' but they were keeping it under wraps."" By the mid-1990s, however, she reports that it had become more acceptable to admit career dissatisfaction (Hornaday 1995, online).Betsy Collard, another career specialist, believes that part of this trend is related to ""how personally knowledge workers view their work and the meaning of it,"" but that it is also related to changes in the economy. ""In times of change, everybody turns inward to get clear about what's important to them, who they are, and what they want out of this"" (ibid.).The career doldrums may also be associated with certain career stages. Careers are like lives in that they go through stages that frequently include transitions into new phases. One framework (Nicholson cited in Kidd 1998) for analyzing work transitions includes the following stages:.   The preparation stage that occurs prior to assuming a work role..   The encounter stage that covers the early days of a career experience in whichindividuals begin to make sense of the chosen career. This stage may include shock,rejection, and regret..   The adjustment stage that involves the period in which individuals learn to do theirwork and make the adjustments necessary to reduce any dissonance between careerchoice and personal traits..   The stabilization stage in which job performance is the main focus. In this stage,failure, boredom, and stagnation are not uncommon.The symptoms associated with the career doldrums are most closely aligned with the stabilization stage. Individuals are not likely to become bored with or dissatisfied with their careers until they have had an opportunity to experience them for a while. Individuals who are in careers that are not a good fit may begin experiencing symptoms in the adjustment stage as they accommodate their careers to their personal traits and aptitudes.Explains the encounter stage that covers the early days of a career experience.Explains the adjustment stage that involves the period in which individuals learn to do their job.Explains the encounter stage that covers the early days of a career experience.Explains the adjustment stage that involves the period in which individuals learn to do their job.Explains the stabilization stage in which job performance is the main focus.Explains that individual careers are multifaceted and no single solution can be applied to those periods of dissatisfaction and boredom.Explains that moving up might mean a change to another company or changing the work emphasis.Opines that downshifting may be a solution for someone who is ready to give greater priority to.Explains that making adaptations in a current career situation is also an option.Explains that many people cope with the career doldrums by finding fulfillment in interests outside of their jobs. the accountant who was suffering a career slump found that she had unused mechanical skills.Explains planned happenstance, a theory that helps individuals develop skills to recognize, create, and use chance in career opportunities.Opines that ""one size fits all"" is not the solution to addressing the career doldrums. hudson poses questions for surviving a midlife career plateau transition that are applicable to other situations when career satisfaction is low.Asks what needs to be done to sustain balance in life and pacing in schedule?Opines that responding to these questions may provide insights into the type of strategies that will be most helpful in curbing the career doldrums.Explains that the concept of career doldrums isn't new, but the more open acknowledgment of the phenomenon.Explains that the symptoms associated with career doldrums are most closely aligned with the stabilization stage.Explains that career counseling can help individuals who are stuck on a career doldrums.Explains that making a career move can be as simple as making changes within the same organization or as radical as shifting into another career field.Explains that a complete change of careers may be the only option because it may mean retraining as well as ""starting over.""Explains how career direction can be repackaged within the flow of new jobs and openings.Cites clarke, caroline v., grannon, and hornaday, ann.

7891a05a,0,"#Reflective Essay on Choosing Career Choice -  - EdubirdieThe role of Women in the digital world was one of the topics that was presented to us on the 11th of October, 2019 by our guest lecturer Paula Neary, a Managing Director within Accenture’s Health and Public Service practice in Ireland. Her extensive experience in leading the successful design and execution of large-scale, complex business and ICT transformation programs across the public service makes her a noteworthy and trusted individual in her field. She delivered a very moving lecture on the current situation of Women in the Technological Industry using various quantitative data and analyses backing up her every claim and notion which was divided into various sub-topics. The various gender imbalances when it came to the number of women pursuing careers in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) were also emphasized deeply by Paula during her presentation.Various points made by Paula really did open our eyes to the issues women face in technology and why we actually require women in the digital economy for example to fill in the STEM skills shortages, the advantage women have over men when it comes to multitasking, etc. This is where she brought up the influences and barriers regarding this issue and put up statistical information that showed how parents and teachers influenced the decision made by males and females in determining their future career choices and decisions; around 49% of females have their career aspirations influenced by their parents and about 58% of career choices in the STEM field have been dropped by children due to issues with their teachers. The argument of stereotypical perceptions also playing a major role in determining career choices is something that really does resonate with current trends in society. The perception that boys are more likely to be influenced by money and the viewpoint that men are more likely to move into the engineering and IT field due to the stereotypical mindset of parents backed by her statistical data shined a very bright light on what’s really happening in the modern world. Paula’s arguments and statistical data on stereotypes, gender imbalances, and lack of female role models in the field of Science and Technology do provide a real insight into the main topic at hand, but one can’t stop themselves from asking the question of what were the root causes of these various stereotypes, what historical and modern-day factors influenced such a trend and what along with the points highlighted by Paula caused this huge imbalance of the role of Women in Technology???After digging into the subject and doing some research myself, I was able to find out that the women in our society have been discriminated against legally, functionally, and structurally in different ways since the 1800s. Surprisingly ancient history records many strong female figures, rulers, and warriors who performed acts that the history writers thought worthy of recording. Names such as Cleopatra, Boudicca, and Esther echo down history to the present day. Even in the early Christian church, there is evidence that women could hold positions of influence equal to men. But all this changed throughout the centuries and even today women cannot be priests in the Catholic church which has followed on from these early traditions. It is only really in the twentieth century that women made any gains in equality which in my opinion is nothing short of revolutionary. Women’s groups were able to campaign successfully to be granted the right to vote. Even during the two world wars women showed their potential by taking the place of men in factories, that they could work outside the home as well as within it, and that they could contribute equally as men to the economy. After World War II, many women were reluctant to go back to their previous lives. They enjoyed the sense of purpose and camaraderie. The feminist revolution of the sixties and seventies went on to change women's experiences forever. While full equality has now been reached it is now natural to see female politicians, doctors, business leaders, and writers. It seems crazy now that a woman could be dismissed as automatically dumber than a man, or that a woman could be barred from a profession because of her gender. This was one of the reasons why I chose to reflect on this topic as I felt that the role of women in the digital field of the industry should not be influenced by stereotypical notions. They should be given the same recognition and considered based on their ability, knowledge, and skill in their career choice. In fact, their career choice should not be based on usual notions of a career in Science and Technology for example but based on their true passion and what they want to pursue not on what they must.    Save your time!We can take care of your essayProper editing and formattingFree revision, title page, and bibliographyFlexible prices and money-back guaranteePlace OrderOne of the points that did stand out for me personally during the presentation was the lack of female role models in the field of Science and Technology. In fact, the main reason for me to get into the career of Audit and Assurance was because I had a really good role model in the form of my father. So, I do understand the need to have a positive influence from an experienced figure, guiding your career on the right path and making sure you take the appropriate steps to be successful in the future. This is why in my opinion this factor needs to improve in order to see any sort of positive change in this field for women now and for the future generations. Another particularly key factor that can be a major influence for us to see a rise in women in STEM subjects and its resulting careers is the information about STEM and the careers itself. Around 31% of parents and 37% of teachers feel that there is inadequate information about STEM subjects which is staggeringly low and could also explain why most of the students today are unaware of the opportunities in this field. This might also be a contributing factor to the stereotypical notion of how STEM subjects match careers for males over females as well. The fact that most of them are unaware of the opportunities along with this stereotype could explain why young people are still yet to be convinced that STEM offers equal opportunities to all along with subconscious stereotyping of STEM subjects as well.This is something I agree with completely as I have seen this happen in India and within my family in particular as well. The common perception in Indian culture for parents is for their male children to either be engineers or doctors and female children to go into the field of management or commerce to be eventually married off to a good well to do family where she will be taking care of the family as a housewife. Parents in India decide their kid's careers rather than them finding their own career path and pursuing something that they are personally passionate about. This stereotype has changed over the past few years, but I still see it in practice quite often even today.In my opinion, the issues mentioned by Paula really need to be addressed to see more participation of women not only in STEM but in other fields too. The fact that even in the 21st century such perceptions and stereotypes still exist is surprising to be honest as one would never think of it existing at all. This presentation was a real revelation not only for me personally but for everyone who was unaware of such issues still affecting the lives of women in today's society. The first step to overcome such prehistoric notions is to make people aware of the issue and back it up with numbers and facts which was done amazingly by Paula. I believe only after that can we expect to take the next step and do something about the issue itself.At the end of the day what is important is that women have a choice about how they want to be and behave and how they spend their time. Women throughout history have not always had that choice - often society has placed strict controls on them. We honestly owe a debt of gratitude to the women who did take the initial steps to fight for equality and thus change the role of women in society forever.            Various points made by Paula really did open our eyes to the issues women face in technology and why we actually require women in the digital economy for example to fill in the STEM skills shortages, the advantage women have over men when it comes to multitasking, etc. This is where she brought up the influences and barriers regarding this issue and put up statistical information that showed how parents and teachers influenced the decision made by males and females in determining their future career choices and decisions; around 49% of females have their career aspirations influenced by their parents and about 58% of career choices in the STEM field have been dropped by children due to issues with their teachers.

Even during the two world wars women showed their potential by taking the place of men in factories, that they could work outside the home as well as within it, and that they could contribute equally as men to the economy. After World War II, many women were reluctant to go back to their previous lives. They enjoyed the sense of purpose and camaraderie. The feminist revolution of the sixties and seventies went on to change women's experiences forever. While full equality has now been reached it is now natural to see female politicians, doctors, business leaders, and writers. It seems crazy now that a woman could be dismissed as automatically dumber than a man, or that a woman could be barred from a profession because of her gender. This was one of the reasons why I chose to reflect on this topic as I felt that the role of women in the digital field of the industry should not be influenced by stereotypical notions. They should be given the same recognition and considered based on their ability, knowledge, and skill in their career choice. In fact, their career choice should not be based on usual notions of a career in Science and Technology for example but based on their true passion and what they want to pursue not on what they must.

So, I do understand the need to have a positive influence from an experienced figure, guiding your career on the right path and making sure you take the appropriate steps to be successful in the future. This is why in my opinion this factor needs to improve in order to see any sort of positive change in this field for women now and for the future generations. Another particularly key factor that can be a major influence for us to see a rise in women in STEM subjects and its resulting careers is the information about STEM and the careers itself. Around 31% of parents and 37% of teachers feel that there is inadequate information about STEM subjects which is staggeringly low and could also explain why most of the students today are unaware of the opportunities in this field. This might also be a contributing factor to the stereotypical notion of how STEM subjects match careers for males over females as well. The fact that most of them are unaware of the opportunities along with this stereotype could explain why young people are still yet to be convinced that STEM offers equal opportunities to all along with subconscious stereotyping of STEM subjects as well.This is something I agree with completely as I have seen this happen in India and within my family in particular as well. The common perception in Indian culture for parents is for their male children to either be engineers or doctors and female children to go into the field of management or commerce to be eventually married off to a good well to do family where she will be taking care of the family as a housewife.

d448fa01,0,"#Servant Leadership Analysis   EssayWriterThe volunteer role that I took on has been extremely pivotal in my comprehension of what servant leadership entails, especially within my chosen career path. This is not to say that other vocations are not equally as valuable, but it is imperative, for this work , to understand that when nurses and other medical personnel fail to deliver what is expected of them, the repercussions can be significantly higher and more severe when compared with other professions.My volunteer experience as a nurse leader has taught me that it is vital to have positive morale in the workplace. For instance, when one of my colleagues felt distraught after losing one of her patients, it became increasingly difficult for her to cater to the needs of the other patients. As a result of my acquaintance’s demoralization, some of the outcomes of the patients were negatively affected (Jackson, 2008). Nonetheless, my leadership skills enabled me to provide advice and moral support for my colleague who was then able to resume her duty of care to the rest of her patients. On the other hand, the volunteer opportunity educated me on the importance of funding for this particular facility. As mentioned in previous works, the veteran’s affairs hospital relies on government funding for most of its operations. During my volunteership there a delay of the financing caused significant problems in the organization’s processes. While patient lives were not lost, it made work impractical subsequently affecting the outcome of some patients. Because the issue took almost three days to resolve, I had to step up as a nurse leader and propose potentially viable solutions to the array of problems that the organization was facing (Shirin, 2015). I participated in everything from motivating my colleagues, demarcation of responsibilities as well as setting up a proper channel of communication to ease the information relay process.Greenleaf, in his work, conveyed several leadership principles which have come to be regarded as the pillars of servant leadership. While I may not have utilized all of them, there are several principles that I had to apply on a daily basis. For instance, providing support to my team, or fostering a nurturing spirit as other pundits have described it, is among the principles that I had to utilize every day during the entirety of my time as a volunteer. Due to the strenuous working environment, it was commonplace for some of the staff to break down emotionally. Under such circumstances I had to provide moral and professional support to my fellow nurses to help them cope better with the pressures of the profession (Shirin, 2015). For example, after understanding that psychological breakdown is especially typical in my line of work, I made it a routine to confer with my colleagues every day and inquire about their social life as well as how they felt about their work and the responsibilities. Besides, I would ensure that the concerns, especially the professional issues, the staff communicated were addressed appropriately. While not all my attempts were successful, I can assert that I also utilized community development in executing my duties as a volunteer nurse leader. For example, I ensured that the organizational policy was in congruence with the needs of the immediate community by constantly communicating with the patients who came from it. Through this process, I managed to understand that a majority of the patients failed to seek early treatment due to lack of adequate information. As a result, I initiated several educational clinics that were successful in promoting positive medical outcome for the patients (Sipe & Frick 2015).Excerpts from biblical scriptures as well as the works of Greenleaf suggest that giving away power often has the result of creating power (Shirin, 2015). In my experience as a servant leader at the Veteran’s Affairs Hospital, it was not my immediate intention to take up a leadership position. Notably, the role of nurse leader is more of a social title at the institution as opposed to a professionally recognized title (Roberts, 2015). Having stated that, I had identified several problems with the systems at the organization such as communication breakdown or miscommunication. Moreover, I had also noted that the staff was somewhat mismanaged which led to some erroneous decision making as well as workplace conflicts. Therefore, I embarked on improving the communication process within the establishments in an attempt to mitigate the problems arising from the lack of adequate communication means. By offering to do this, I found nurses coming to me with inquiries concerning what information should be relayed to whom. Eventually, I discovered that nurses preferred to seek my opinion concerning all communication issues at work and in addition, they invited me to listen to their concerns about both their professional and private lives. Therefore, I have to concur with Greenleaf’s suggestions that it is through giving away the power that we gain it.Greenleaf asserted that it was extremely imperative that servant leaders, through their leadership, create a culture of change which will ultimately serve to promote the greater good. In my particular experience as a servant leader at the institution, this assertion is verifiable. As mentioned in the paragraph above I mainly used my position as a volunteer to improve the communication mechanism amongst the hospital’s staff. While it was difficult in the beginning, the nurses and other staff recognized the importance of maintaining a system of support for the nurses and ensuring that there is clear communication between all the staff and the management personnel. First and foremost, they recognized that a lack in such structures not only impacted the employees but the patients as well (Chatbury et al., 2011). Upon realizing the direct benefits to the patients, the staff promptly established informal communication channels that would last long after I had left my service at the organization. On the other hand, the team also developed a staff support body that would ensure that the professional needs of the staff are fulfilled. When carefully analyzed, these measures evolved as a consequence of my actions as a nurse leader. Therefore it would be correct to insist that because of my utilization of servant leadership that positive changes were made within the organization. Most importantly, the measures installed have significantly developed the work ethic and job satisfaction of the staff in addition to improving the quality of care for the patients, which can be considered as the most significant good (Shirin, 2015).The opportunity to volunteer as a nurse leader has given me a lot of personal insight especially concerning my leadership skills as well as my leadership style. First and foremost I have learned that I am a very active listener. As stated by Greenleaf, it is important that a servant leader takes time to listen. Greenleaf holds that it is only through listening that a leader may fully comprehend the needs of his team and the community (Liden et al., 2014). Therefore, I made an effort to enquire what the personnel thought would greatly improve the working conditions. Similar approaches are what led me to develop community outreach programs for community building. Another thing I have learned is that I can be very patient and accommodating which is a preference for servant leaders. It is because of this trait that I have managed to handle instances of significant conflict at the organization. Having established this, I have found that my leadership style is more in agreement with the laissez-faire approach which is non-authoritarian and indirect (Sendjaya, 2016).The principles I have learned from the coursework as well as my experience as a servant leader that Greenleaf’s laws are applicable in a variety of situations whether it is on a personal level or within an organization. When serving in a professional capacity, I will use the principles to first build the community surrounding the institution because of the value of community support (Parris & Peachey, 2013). Second, I will also utilize the principles to develop the skills of my team within the workplace further so that they can be in a position to advance themselves both personally and professionally. Concerning my personal use of these principles, I will use the principles of listening and empathy to further improve my interactions with people.",1
2ceccbf7,0,"#Closing the College-Career Gap -   Critical Writing ExampleIntroductionFor many, attending college is still seen as the guarantee of a dream job. In reality, things sometimes look very different. Education has been associated with many doors and chances for prosperity, but this reality has changed over time. Despite the training and efforts made by various sectors, both public and private, to manage and support the education sector, students continue to leave high schools and universities without the necessary skills to succeed in the real world. Higher education is no longer a selective, elitist system as it used to be but has become a part of the global mass market. Study on Employability Skill Gaps Among IT Graduates: Exploring Employers’ Views is an article published by Awadhiya in 2022 at the Indira Gandhi National Open University. The author claims that employers, and stakeholders in higher education, demand that higher education institutions provide graduates who are prepared for the workforce. However, it is not being realized, and businesses are constantly having trouble locating qualified graduates with modern employability skills. Graduates with the necessary employability are tough to find for employers worldwide (Awadhiya, 2022). The curriculum does not provide the skills necessary to enter the workforce. There is a disconnect between the knowledge one learns in school and the abilities one needs to function in everyday life, such as problem-solving abilities, language understanding, logical thinking, or data interpretation. Schools entirely disregard the soft skills needed in today’s business environment and only concentrate on grading. Enterprise and academic institutions must engage with each other and work together to understand what the industry expects of them by adopting learning practices relevant in the current business environment.SummaryAccording to Awadhiya, a gap exists between college and career because higher education institutions do not implement creative methods of skill development to prepare their graduates for employment. Employers have concerns about the academic curricula and program delivery methods in relation to the employability skill gap, and they suggest that the higher education system is supply-dominated rather than demand-driven (Awadhiya, 2022). The higher education system is universally held responsible for this gap; hence it is believed that colleges will need to work diligently to close it. To close this gap, they must be aware of the employability skills that are unique to each degree and help their graduates acquire them. Awadhiya also analyzes the essential employability skills for graduates, followed by employer perspectives on skills among graduates. The most important task for colleges is that they should be able to teach students how to adapt and learn fast. Due to limited infrastructure, human resources, diversity of regional demands, and a large number of competitive students, traditional skill development methods cannot close this demand-supply gap. The author discovers that such skills as learning agility, interpersonal skills, integrity and values, and result orientation are needed to widen the gap between college and career. Therefore, if graduates train such skills in college, they wouldn’t meet any difficulties with finding a job in the future.ResponseConsidering the summary described above, it is possible to agree that the level of education and employment opportunities are closely related. In modern times, it is important to clarify if people are attending college to obtain an education or to obtain employment in addition to their degree. One can postulate that the education gotten should assist a person in life with valuable skills regardless of the following life pathways. As for now, one could fully agree with Awadhiya that the educational system is not held responsible for ensuring that students are adequately prepared with the skills and abilities to pursue a career where they can achieve financial stability. Additionally, the traditional four-year degree requirement remains the main criterion used by businesses to assess the employability of job candidates (Hansen, 2021). Simply put, the outdated method is ineffective in the modern environment. The educational system should be reevaluated to equip students with employable skills better. Additionally, organizations must modify the way they assess applicants and job criteria. The education sector can help the economy recover from the epidemic and avoid future job deficits by tackling this issue head-on.In addition, it is possible to agree with Awadhiya that this gap will always exist since imperfections are unavoidable. Currently, there are millions of unfilled job opportunities due to the inability of education institutions to adequately train job seekers for the workplace and the irrational company expectations regarding the skill sets of their workers. Therefore, individuals should be prepared to cope with their drawbacks by proactively changing employment and working (Teichler, 2022). This recalls 1967 The Los Angeles Times editors’ response to Reagan: “If a university is not a place where intellectual curiosity is to be encouraged, and subsidized, then it is nothing” (Brown, 2018, p.51). It is everyone’s responsibility to take care of their education and not rely on a college only. Moreover, to close the gap between college and career, some employers offer on-job training and internships to assist graduates in finding their dream job. Employers should keep improving the credibility of skill-based employment and dispel misconceptions about education and training.However, it also is needed to respond to Awadhiya’s assumption that it is the collaborative obligation of employers, students, society, and policymakers to close the employability skill gap. Given their inherent limits, higher system institutions alone are not accountable for doing so. For example, students have always had a tough time getting an internship, but things got considerably more difficult when the pandemic struck, and firms decided to cancel their programs. Internships are essential for students since they are one of the best ways for graduates to land their first job. This widened the gap between career and college, which is already an issue (Martin, 2021). To solve this problem, all sides should cooperate. The most obvious solutions are developing relevant curricula, tracking the outcomes of studies at colleges, and for employers to be more willing to provide graduates with their first job experience.ConclusionAll things considered, to match educational programs with the competencies required for jobs in the real world, higher education institutions should work with employers. The purpose of the curriculum should be to develop long-lasting and enduring ways of thinking, methods to solve problems, and approach knowledge. It is time to reevaluate education strategies to make them more career ready. Awadhiya indicates that employers are finding it challenging to find the relevant employability skills among the graduates. Still, he does not specify why this gap is also employers’ responsibility. There are plenty of perspectives for this research, such as studying ways to close this gap, strategies that can support new graduates in employment, or how the state can assist in fighting this issue. In order to study this issue, it is necessary to look further for other scientists’ analyses and study what skills are in demand on the market to shape the educational system in a more proficient way.",1
be5b1618,0,"#Employee Engagement and Career Stages  It is a well-known and established fact that employees’ engagement augments the performance of organizations. Top executives recognize that employee engagement can increase the productivity and performance of organizations while minimizing the costs of recruitment (Markos & Sridevi, 2010). The world market has become very competitive in terms of business and employees. As a result, the organizations tend to offer better perks to lure competent candidates. Under these circumstances, it becomes crucial for organizations to ensure that there is a culture of employee engagement between the workforces so that the turnover is not negligible. It is understood that employees change jobs if they are not satisfied with their prevailing job profile, salary, facilities, working environment, and responsibilities among others (Haid & Sims, 2009). Different employees have distinct perspectives about their jobs, especially in regard to the strategies applied to manage the organization. The management can be authoritative basing respect and fear as the major factors determining motivation. On the other hand, it can initiate some motivating drivers to improve competition between employees and facilitate commitments. These strategies involve such drivers as promotions, increment in salaries, awards, tour, and holidays among others. These perspectives decide the level of commitment of employees towards their organizations. Employee engagement is a result of commitment, which in turn is influenced by various engagement levers/drivers (Soni, 2013). The aim of this research is to evaluate several engagement levers/drivers that help organizations in retaining their workforce and increasing employee commitment.Effective WorkingManagement development training in an organization helps in making effective work in the management. The rapport created between the managers under training ensures that they engage each other in decision making and sharing of ideas. This will make their duties be done the right way and effectively.SupportManagement development training brings together many intelligent brains with different ideas that when put in one room may come up with great ideas. Some of the ideas are improved while others are invented. The training helps a lot in the management of the business. The support created between the managers is important to the company.Organization Improvement and ChangeThe focus on management development is important for the organization improvement and change. The training for the managers improves their management skills as they exchange a lot of ideas and structures that enhance better and more qualified ways of management.Technical Knowledge and Skills and Interpersonal Knowledge and SkillsTechnical Knowledge and SkillsTechnical knowledge is the full understanding of anything that can be used or applied in various forms for any duties at work or home. On the other hand, a technical skill is when someone can do a duty skillfully whilst applying their knowledge. The growth for the need of technical skills is at a high rate, as the world technological advancement is rising faster. The networking system of many organizations relies on the technical knowledge and skills of these individuals.Interpersonal Knowledge and SkillsInterpersonal knowledge is a good communication skill that an individual has attained and the ability to use it. On the other hand, the interpersonal skill is the daily use of life proficiencies to engage in a useful and important communication between people. In the market, most employees seek to employ or hire staff members with high interpersonal skills. Examples of interpersonal skills include verbal and non-verbal communication, listening skills, negotiation skills, problem solving, decision-making skills, and assertiveness.ReferenceOosterhof, A.

After putting all one’s energy into doing his/her job well -- answering to a boss's, co-workers', clients', and/or employees' demands. The last thing a parent may feel like doing is answering to their child's. However, these thoughts just make people feel guilty.  These and other problems are more common in today’s households than society may realize.  The stresses people face in the workplace today are far more demanding than they were during their parents careers.Today’s workforce is made up of just as many women as men, and in many cases, both parents have careers which leaves little in the way of quality time for children, and/or social time for adults.

ef7447a0,0,"#Overview of the Job Duties of a Cashier -    The world of work is undergoing drastic transformations these days (Guffey 5) and the working experience becomes one of the most important factors which may influence the employer’s decision regarding hiring the personnel. My working experience for the present day is not as rich as I would like it to be, but I have already learned some things which will be useful for me in the future. From October 5, 2007, till October 10, 2008, I worked as a cashier in Oakland, CA. A job of a cashier includes definite duties and requires attention and responsibility; it is easy to cope with all the challenges this job may entail if one has a desire to learn and gain experience.What were the job and location?What were the main duties and obligations?What were the challenges the job entailed?During my work as a cashier, I had a number of duties and obligations. I ensured fast and friendly customer service communicating with the customers and helping them to choose what they were going to purchase. I also answered numerous phone calls and solved different problems with people I worked with. Moreover, I watched my work area remain clean and organized because this, like nothing else, helps to create the necessary working atmosphere. Lastly, I operated a cash register and processed cash as well as credit cards.Any work demands certain skills which may be achieved by special training. I did not know much when I started working as a cashier, but each day I learned something new and useful. Cashiers guide people through the process of their purchase scanning the purchased items, taking money, and completing the transaction. Despite all the responsibility this work involves, it usually requires little or no experience. The cashiers are expected to have good manual dexterity and mathematical skills, but the most important is that they should be able to accurately do repetitious work. Learning how to work with the cash register does not require much time; what matters here is to stay attentive all the time and memorize all the necessary key combinations.The work of a cashier also demands responsibility. A cashier cannot easily leave his/her working place, because the sums of money he/she is responsible for are often quite big. Cash register shortages may occur because of being inattentive. Sometimes the cashier can simply return the missing money from his/her own salary, but very often shortages result in dismissal for they are the sign of inaccuracy and incompetence of the cashier. Attention is a key to success in the job of a cashier, and any distraction during the day may hinder this success.Taking into consideration everything mentioned above, it can be concluded that any work demands skills and devotion. Thus, the work of a cashier requires an ability to communicate with the customers, practical skills of work with the cash register, certain mathematical skills, and the ability to do repetitious and monotonous work with the greatest possible attention. Challenges that one may encounter at the beginning of the work may be easily overcome with time. All it takes is some experience and the ability to adapt to the changes easily. My working as a cashier helped me to acquire the necessary experience and served as a preparation for a more serious job I will easily cope with in the future.",1
4db2981e,0,"#Career Management in the 21st Century -    Career Management in the 21st CenturyThe Necessity for Career Management in the 21st  Century.Many people determine ""what they want to be when they grow up"" just as soon as they are able to talk, but the truth is, by the time they graduate high school, they change your mind at least five times.  When a person first enter high school, their teachers and guidance counselors should explain what classes need to be taken in order to enter college.  By the time one reaches their senior year, their career path(s) and a career outline that supports the path should be determined. In addition, a realistic set of goals should be created. An individual should research the best school that meets their career choices, know what college classes  must be taken, and lastly they should began researching jobs for the chosen career(s) choice. However, even with all this planning, a career path is still not really defined until an individuals sophomore year in college. According to the article, ""Career Entrenchment..."", the authors stated that ""many people choose their career at the age of eighteen or nineteen, before they know all about the available choices"" (Carson & Carson, 1996). Career management is a necessity because an individual can plan their career early so that they won’t be forced into a job that they are really unsatisfied with. The authors also stated that ""Individuals too often select careers based on their perceived ability, experience, or skill"" not by their interests (Carson & Carson, 1996). That’s why career management is a really important aspect for a persons  future plans. Individuals should always choose a career that interests them not one that’s based on salary or perceived success. That way, changes can be made if they occur and a person will know how to balance their personal life and their career.

c725c2f5,0,"#Business Career Plan for the Next 5 Years  A career plan is a process in which one chooses what is best for him or her. It is also a form in which he or she satisfies his or her future job interest. The plan assists to develop talent and skills, as well as decide the training and elements one should consider to nature this skill (Miller & Marvin 2006). It also implies how one can utilize resources and future advancement of the career. This paper gives concise guidelines on formulating a personal, career plan for the next five years will be. The papers will also outline short and long-term goals and compare them to personal goals and constraints. The career of choice is opening up a salon.Currently, I am pursuing a degree course in business management. Upon graduation, I intend to open up a salon business. Opening the business is not an immediate objective since I also intend to gain knowledge and exposure in the wide business field. At the moment, the main weakness is the lack of knowledge about starting and running a business. Another weakness is that the business idea in mind has not been drafted or documented.This makes it difficult to prospect issues such as capital. Raising capital for the start-up is also a weakness that I’m experiencing currently. Currently, my major strength is being able to learn how to combine the knowledge skills, and experience to make achievements. Additionally, I will be able to specialize in this form of business and to have room for flexibility. The degree course will channel ways of knowing specifics about the career path I am taking.ObjectivesMy objective is to enroll in a higher learning institution and study business management. This is to fulfill my ambitions to open up a salon business shortly. Additionally, I should be able to handle all business elements with a positive attitude and lots of enthusiasm. Assisting family members financially is also part of my objectives. On the other hand, the business objectives are mainly measurable targets needed to be achieved to term the business a successful business.My short term goals for the business are to establish a sustainable business that will for all customers’ expectations in service and product. Another goal is to strive and build a strong clientele of the business. Also, I intend to have average clients increase by 15% per year until I manage a superior performance. Moreover, my business will provide services of the highest quality with excellent customer support.My long-term goals will cut across the business entity. I intend to expand the business by opening up new premises in nearby towns within the next five years. Another goal is to increase market sales and generate more revenue. Besides, I should be able to maintain and increase the market share of the products and services in all the business premises under my name (Waddock 2008, p2013). The business will be a key point for providing employment opportunities to the skilled qualified personnel in this field. Another r long term objective is to be the leading salon service provider in the region.PESTLE analysisAn extensive environmental scan ensures all external and internal threats are handled. This analysis will assist to determine factors such as environment, political social technology, and economic factors that will influence the growth of the business. Politically there are numerous regulations set up by the government for one to establish a business. The business will be hard hit with labor policies for the staff, tax policies, and environmental law and trade restrictions (PESTLE Analysis, 2012).These policies will in turn influence the economy of the business. Strict employment laws and other informal rules have forced the venture to be cumbersome. Nevertheless, the authority restriction will slow the short term goal of having a profitable business entity. This is because the profit made will be channeled to cater to government regulation in terms of paying for licenses among other government remittances.Environmental factors will affect the business in terms of geographical position. Locating the salon near an urban area will generate more revenue since most urban dwellers like to look smart always. This will combine with social factors such as cultural preference. The near social environment, which includes the family members, will contribute immensely to the business. The family members will contribute capital to the startup of this business.The population growth will also contribute positively to the business (PESTLE Analysis 2012). The age distribution in the environment will contribute to setting the trends in hairstyles done by the salons. Young age individuals are known to be trendy in hairstyles. Emphasis on the health and safety of the client will be a key observation by staff. The various safety measures to be installed in the business will be quite costly.Technology advance influences the efficiency of the business. There is also an increase in technological incentives, in the market. Installations of these technological gadgets will be expensive hence hindering quality service delivery. This prompts the business to be up to date with technological change. With the prediction of this high demand, outsourcing for crucial services when needed will be sorted (PESTLE Analysis 2012). This is another disadvantage to the business.Economic factors such as inflation and the high-interest rate will negatively affect the business. However, economic growth will contribute to the stability of the business. In the next five years, the business environment is expected to change drastically. The technology aspect of the business is predicted to advance further. The social factors such as cultural aspects and age preference among potential clients will be far much different from the current.Therefore, the business should operate in a manner that it will be able to adapt to changes. As indicated before, the business will be flexible to current trends in the market. The business will be the image of the community since it will channel the resources back to the community. This will be achieved by providing job opportunities or providing financial aid to the needy in society.SWOT analysisThe SWOT analysis will capture key strengths and weakness relating to the market analysis summary and describes the opportunities and threats facing the business (Waddock 2008). My main SWOT analysis will concentrate on key business units and an assessment of the core functions. These functions include marketing, human relations, finance and accounting, operations, and logistics.The strengths will prove that the business’ ability to establish personalized client service. A key, a stronghold will establish strong relationships with suppliers. This will bring about the flexibility of suppliers and quick responses to specific product delivery. The loyalty of clients is to be nurtured via a robust reputation among returning high purchase clients.Weakness may affect my aim and distort the target time. A tangible flaw will be the duration of going up the retail skill learning curve. The business will be situated in a market that has a variety of salon business options. This will prove a hard task to acquire clients. Besides, seasonality of the business poses an enormous challenge to the business (Barnet 2006).Opportunities are immense in the market. There is a significant portion of the target market that is desperate for that unique service that my business is ready to offer. The market is a promising market with strategic alliances offering sources for referrals and joint marketing activities to extend the business reach (Waddock 2008). The demand for more salons in the area has prompted the establishment of this business.Threats could not also be overlooked. There is continued price pressure due to stiff competition in the market. This has weakened the market to some extent hence reducing margin contribution. Variations in customer likes can avail of the challenge of keeping up with the client’s preferences. Another threat is the expansion of products and services offered by the established business in the local market. These established have gone ahead to set prices for the market.This scrutiny shows a robust potential achievement; the flaws and threats ought to be identified at all times during the life of the business. With this analysis, I can be able to assess if the business is making the most out of opportunities available. It also outlines changes in the external environment. It is an excellent formality to keep my competitors in check. Combining this analysis and the PESTLE analysis of this business will ensure the business is efficient with minimum market problems (PESTLE Analysis 2012).In the comparison of the scenario at the moment and my prospects, they are quite different. The projected level of skill and knowledge differs substantially from the current. The skills acquisition and knowledge in business management will be achieved with time (Barnet 2006, p. 258). The potential to be an effective, responsible, productive, and satisfied individual is the driving factor towards attaining these goals. At the moment, the time at disposal is utilized in majoring in the weakness and possible threats. This is done by attending lessons on business management to acquire skills and knowledge. Academic pursuit is the most appropriate form of gaining technical skills nearly.Risk analysisVarious risks face this plan. The business risks facing stiff competition in the market. This will risk the business being faced out of the market if it will not be innovative. There is also the risk of new entrants into the market that will substitute the services offered. Another massive risk is political interference by revoking the business license. The risk for failure of the business is exceptionally high.This may be caused by financial problems such as bankruptcy too many liabilities and lack of proper investors. Another possible risk is operational risk. This is where there may be a lack of qualified personnel in the job market for employing in business. The risk analysis produces a comprehensive report on the situation of the business.To thrive through all these risks, it is advisable to be innovative and creative. Self-confidence and having the zeal to achieve the interest pursued. A proper way of dealing with risks is to ensure there is a continuity of operations plan and limit liabilities. Nevertheless, risk management strategies put in place will enable the recognition and prevention of threats that the business faces (Barnet 2006, p. 258). This will also channel ways in which resources can be allocated effectively.Personal lessons learnedBy achieving the business goals maximally, I should be able to accumulate a substantial amount of profit. This career plan is a clear indication of the direction intended in life (Miller & Marvin 2006). It acts as an eye-opener to the future career I intend to pursue. All the achievements will be attained through hard work and desire to make a difference in a future life (Jones 2010, p. 24). This plan enables one to build a career in the choice project by project. The process also simplifies the steps of attaining lifetime objectives (Barnet 2006, p. 259).",1

db835d09,0,"#Opportunity Cost in Higher Education -   Case Study ExampleOpportunity cost is the sacrifice one has to make so that he or she can get the best alternative possible. In life, there are choices to make. The choices have consequences.A student does not choose to go to college because there is nothing else to do. There are very many things that the student could have done. For instance, going to school would deny the student the opportunity to work (Beach 370). It also denies him or her the opportunity to just rest. Perhaps the student could have used the school fees to invest in a business that would make him or her successful. The student could also opt for a mentor in the career he wants to pursue in life.However, the opportunity cost is not the sum of all the other things the student would have done. Some of the things like resting would not replace the alternative benefit. Opportunity cost also deals with the benefit that one would have derived from the alternative action (Arora and Nandkumar 250).The opportunity cost of spending an evening revising for an economics exam is watching a movie. It can also be resting as one prepares for the exam. During the evening one could also have read a novel or written a book. One could also revise for a different paper other than economics.For one to make a sensible decision about what to do that evening, it would be prudent to understand the time table of the exam. Maybe the economics exam would be several days away or the following day. Another critical issue would be to know the reason for passing the economics exam (Greenwood and Holt 178). The question in the student’s mind would be to know if that was one’s choice of career in life. It would also be prudent for the student to know if what he or she is foregoing is equally as important as passing the economics exam.In making the list for the opportunity cost for higher education, food is not part of it because the student would eat whether in school or at home. The food budget cannot be an alternative to education. It could be an alternative to fasting for the spiritual benefit or health condition. Food benefits the body but education benefits someone psychologically, socially, and economically (Shoup 412).The cost of clothing should not be part of the list of opportunity costs. Whether the student attends school or not, he or she will still need those clothing (Horngren, Datar, and Rajan 501). The student can buy clothes and still go to school. The benefit that the student would derive from education cannot be similar or opposite to that of buying or not buying clothes.Higher education will improve and expand the student’s thoughts about the career he or she has chosen. It will also enable him or her to become employable and knowledgeable about the endeavor he or she will pursue in life. Higher education will also enable the student to afford what he or she sacrificed for education. Higher education gives one status in the society (Chodorow-Reich and Karabarbounis 330).Opportunity cost to one attending higher education is different from the opportunity costs to society as a whole. The individual benefits would enable the student to pursue personal ambition. The society would expect community service. The community would also benefit because the student would concentrate on learning and not other harmful behaviors like becoming a drug addict. One similarity is that the individual status affects the society. As education builds an individual’s capacity, it also builds community capacity.Works CitedArora, Ashish and Anand Nandkumar.

b4b88358,0,"#Generational Differences in Work and Career Growth  IntroductionThe concept of generation as a viable source of social stratification was introduced by Mannheim in 1952. It was one of the key areas of study that had to be researched to gain further knowledge in the field of sociology (Mannheim, 1952). In such a way, Mannheim tried to gain further understanding of the existential basis of knowledge. He used this knowledge in order to study the growth of conservative thought in modern societies (Turner, 1999). The understanding of these different generational groups in any social setup is very important for the development and growth of a given society (Coates, 2007).Generational gaps amongst the young and the old usually occur due to a number of factors. Most of these factors are mainly attributed to the rapid changes in the social lives within these two groups. The representatives of these groups tend to have very different interests with regards to music, fashion, culture, politics, and even in the manner in which they speak. These gaps began to manifest themselves in the early 1950s and 60s. There were very many changes in social scenes as the age-old dating habits were changing mainly due to the great influence of the media at that time. Teenagers were listening to music which was very different from the one that the parents preferred. In addition, the movies of this time were about rebellious kids. The main theme of these movies during that time was rebellious juveniles who did anything to earn a living; it was a result of the tough period that was prevailing. All these facts gave birth to a new breed of the generation called baby boomers. The baby boomers saw themselves as being very hip. Much of their influence was the rock and roll scenes that were very widespread at the time. The individuals of this age group are now between the ages of 45 and 65 years. These individuals have specific characteristics. For example, most of them are not very welcoming to new ideas and technologies.Children born between 1970 and 1980 belong to generation X. The origin of the name ‘Generation X’ came about as a result of the high drug abuse which was common among many parents at that time. Most of those parents neglected their children. As a result, many people of this generation were seen as slackers (Strauss & Howe, 1991). Members of this generational group are now in their 30’s and early 40s. Most of them are well educated as more than half attended colleges. In addition, most of them are ethnically diverse. They hold good professions. They are also very experimental as they like trying out new ideas and technologies. This generation has high divorce rates due to the fact that family values of that time had changed. Women tend to be more liberal and a large number of them have joined the workforce.Generation Y are the children that were born between the late 1980s and early 1990s. They are also known as the millennial generation. They are the most diverse generation in history as their parents belong to baby boomers or generation of X category. They are mostly well aware of the most advanced technology and know-how to use the internet very well. Their preferred learning environments consist of technology and teamwork. They have the ‘can–do’ attitude of a veteran, teamwork capabilities (similar to that of the baby boomers), and the technology savvy of generation X.Our Case StudyI am 25 years old and thus I belong to the generation Y category class. The interview that I conducted was with a 57-year-old bank manager called Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones belongs to the baby boomer generational class. He is married and has two children; a son called Jason aged 24, and a daughter, Ashley aged 19. Both of his children are college students. His wife is a homemaker with a small grocery where she sells for the local community.The focus of this interview was to find out the various generational differences with respect to work and career growth. These generational differences define the set of values and potential of the people that belong to the same age group. Mr. Jones belongs to the baby boomers generation that was prior knowledge that I possessed. We talked about the major events that took place in his life. He told me that he fought in Vietnam and how life was very difficult after the war. Two parents with a stay at home mother that made his childhood worth remembering raised him. The family was everything at their time that seems not to be the case with the current generation of parents as there is a high rate of divorce cases. He knows the life of working hard and providing for his family. According to him, the individuals of the present generation seem to run away from responsibilities unlike the people of his times. Furthermore, they do not value family life as they are more focused on their careers, he has the perception that women are supposed to stay at home and take care of children as it was with his mother and wife.During the 1950s, men were supposed to go to work, and women were supposed to take care of the house and bear the emotional responsibility of the family (Moen, 1998). This separation of work reduced the impact on the family by its members in case the father had to add more hours at work or was to go away for a long period as the work required it (Moen, 1998). Father was the breadwinner and wife was the housekeeper, thus emotional roles were separated as father worried about his family’s financial stability and wife was to provide emotional stability. In general, with this respect, many people from the baby boomer generation prefer to find wives that will be staying at home mothers as opposed to career women. They have an opinion that each partner will know his or her role in the family and thus there will be more trust in handling responsibilities at home. Women who work are seen as a problem as they tend to blur the gender boundaries that defined men’s responsibility for work-related issues and women’s responsibility for life-related issues (Quick et al, 2004).Mr. Jones thinks that nowadays gender roles are much less defined and all employees he works with now deal with both aspects of homemaking and breadwinning. This effect has resulted in more people worrying about life issues while they are supposed to be working. The intrusion of their private life in the workplace may result in them worrying about their job when they are supposed to be relaxing at home (Quick et al, 2004).Baby boomers are a generation with the least amount of experience and the change in gender roles at the workplace. Changes in the workplace tended to fade during their working years, thus they have difficulties accepting these changes nowadays. To them, when they joined the workforce, they had the idea that a successful work was a male worker who was committed to a long-term position in the company and did not let personal life interfere with work-life (Moen, 1998). They indeed cared for their families but they were not expected to show this at the workplace.Women born at the time period of the baby boomer were expected to be housewives and those who were lucky enough to enter into the workplace acted the same. They were very demanding and controlling so as not to show emotion. They acted as the male version of baby boomer with little or no difference at all. Most of those women ended up being alone as their equation could not include a stay at home husband and thus was very unrealistic.Baby boomer’s work-life balance is very unstable because they have experienced a lot of changes with regard to the switch of traditional gender roles in the workplace. Workmates in the generation X category have grown up with women in the workplace and thus have gained some acceptance to it. They can easily cut short their careers if they see that it is interfering with their lives. Due to the neglect that most of them faced during childhood, they tend to have feelings of resentment towards the time and energy they devote to work. Millennials are the youngest group in the workforce as most of them are young. They have difficulty in balancing work and life. They have a tendency of indulgence in either. To them, they expect diversity in the workplace.Baby boomers have now tried to embrace women in their place of work and even show more respect to them and the contribution they make. Baby boomers like to be in charge and thus most of them are found in senior positions in the workplace. They like to star in the workplace and usually have big prospects for the departments they work in. They are more than willing to share their vision with any of their workmates as long as they get the recognition they deserve. They like to take risky projects, but try to avoid diligent blame when they fail. Technology is a big issue for them, as most of them are not very tech-savvy.In the workplace, there should be a balance between these different generations (baby boomers and generation X) and have an understanding of how each of them works to reduce conflicts and underperformance. With the looming retirement of most baby boomers, the workplace should strive to attract and accommodate all these generational groups as they bring different features to the organization at large. Workplace policies and leadership approaches may need to become flexible in addressing issues related to inclusiveness, recognition, and alignment of generational values of workers in order to create greater work-life balance (Deloitte, 2006)ConclusionIt is very hard to find just one kind of generation group in any successful workplace. All these elements, from baby boomers, generation x, and generation y are very important for any organization to prosper. Bridging the generational gap require great acknowledgment of all generational differences. Generational differences might cause a lot of work frustration but leaders in these organizations should understand each of them and appreciate the positive attributes they offer to the organization.",1
d6897289,0,"#Organization Development in Career Path Choice -   IntroductionOrganization Development (OD) is a set of methods and systems aimed at improving collective behavior, and therefore the culture and performance of the organization. This complex helps to better understand the organization, identify its goals, and develop certain values within the team. The methods used in the organization’s development should lead not only to group effectiveness but also to building trust within the team. Implementing such methods lies far beyond the boundaries of business processes and includes the psychological, sociological, and even political aspects of employee behavior.Career PathThe OD field can be viewed as a career path itself, but as a part of it, that can be followed and guided. Organizational development is a set of values and cultural dimensions that dictate the behavior of employees in order to achieve corporate goals. The very work activity in organizations where there are collectives of employees is subject to the influence of the complex, but in its, essence it is an act of any profession. In other words, when choosing a profession, OD plays an important role, but the most important points in choosing a career path are the education received, interest in professional activity, the location of the office relative to home, the amount of salary, the availability of benefits, and much more.Nevertheless, OD is quite an attractive reference point when choosing your career path. Companies using OD approaches pay more attention to the climate within the workforce, try to create an environment for increasing interest in work, and create the opportunity for each employee to influence the working environment. This experience allows not only to increase interest in the activities of the company but also to improve qualifications in organizing their own communication skills. Many modern studies highlight the relationship between effective communication skills, resulting in leadership qualities, and implementing the theory of organizational development (Ballaro et al., 2020). Such a specific influence will be useful not only for the team of employees but also for the leaders. The trusting relationship of the team very often develops according to the example of communication with the management – the manager handles their words, trusts, and believes in each employee, comes to the rescue as their own, and clearly defines the goals of the company, communicates them in simple language to the employees.However, it should also be considered several nuances of this complex. First, an organizational development plan in a company’s strategy does not always mean its successful implementation. In the absence of positive results and negative moods within the team, additional activities that promote agreement and shared values will only exacerbate the situation in the company. Somewhere you will have to look for a balance between employee productivity and organizational development activities because the latter can take time away from the main professional activity. Second, there are a lot of determinants of the character and mood of each employee outside of work activities. Even the best OD strategy will not improve pay conditions, distance from home, or personal problems.ConclusionThus, organizational development can be a career guide, a source of leadership and effective communication skills, and provide an irreplaceable experience of integrating culture and values into the collective behavior of employees and the development of productivity because of this application. It always required deeper analysis to understand – this or that company needs this approach. Finally, the presence or absence of an OD strategy is not a fundamental factor in choosing a career path.ReferenceBallaro, J. M., Mazzi, M. A., & Holland, K. (2020).

Many adults had little or no career education, guidance, or counseling when they were ""in school "" and often seek such help now, making job or career changes spurred by their personal stage of development or by the ""postmodern"" workplace.

Some analysts proclaim the ""new rules of work"" : everyone is self-employed and the concept of ""job "" is disappearing (Hall and Mirvis 1995). Such fundamental changes mean that people need more help than ever with career issues.

421d359c,0,"#Making Career Choices: Refinery -   IntroductionPeople give preference to different careers for various reasons depending on their needs. Occupational choice remains to be a difficult decision in view of many factors examined. Usually, consideration is given to different factors before opting for a specific profession. Teachers, parents, pastors, peers, role models, life and occupational experiences, religious beliefs, and even technological advancements play a key role in influencing vocational choices of individuals. In most cases, peoples’ close associates influence them to enroll for certain jobs. I was convinced to choose my career by work experience in a refinery, the monetary benefits, and the rising demand that my career aspiration had.What Led to My Career Choice of a Process TechnicianWhen I joined a local refinery, I was employed as a control panel operator. As a new worker, my responsibilities were limited to the control room alone. While performing my duties, I interacted mostly with process technicians, developed a passion for their job, and began to learn the basics. My experience working in a refinery served to my advantage as I was able to close on my learning curve within a short time.In most cases, I was analyzing the engineering procedures concerning quality operations. Later, I learnt that the process technicians were paid thrice as much as control panel operators due to the demand for the former’s services in the refinery. In a training capacity, I began performing as a procedure machinist but with no additional pay rise as I had no schooling certificate. Then, I resolved to join a course in operation artisan tutelage in the ensuing days to ensure I had an education testimonial.The Benefits I Hope to Attain from the Career ChoiceThe process technician job has more benefits attached to it than any other position in a refinery company. Contrary to many positions becoming redundant in an industry setup, a procedure machinist post is becoming more useful. An operation machinist is a secured vocation in a refinery because it depends on existence of the human life on earth (Lewis 48). Equally important, there is a relatively higher compensation package for the vocation of a process technician compared to other engineering task in a refining field. The pay scale in the process technician career ranges from $18 to $31 per hour (Lewis 48).Notably, the pay for this particular job specification is making many people like I, to be attracted to it. The career of a process technician also enables one to have a deep understanding of different refinery equipment as the work necessitates to make adjustments to the instruments from time to time (Lewis 48). Importantly, I shall be able to improve my skills set as well as exploring the field of industrial processing to ensure the desired level of competence is achieved.In conclusion, career paths chosen by someone can be influenced by monetary value, the demand of the occupation, as well as the professional experience one has in a particular field. Most importantly, the career goal should be guided by a devotion for the job. The reason why so much priority is placed on passion is to ensure that pursuance of a career is goal-driven. Essentially, job security, development of skills set, and salary scale should also be put as guiding factors in job options. Therefore, career choice should be given a wider perspective of all benefits and not a narrow view of salary expectation alone.Work CitedLewis, Paul.

20c204d5,0,"#Gender Stereotypes in Families  Gender stereotypes are still persistent in societies that often seem to be egalitarian. According to numerous studies, these stereotypes are transmitted to younger generations that copy their parents’ role models. This paper dwells upon this issue with a focus on the way parents’ professional preferences affect their children’s career aspirations. This paper involves the analysis of the research by Croft, Schmader, Block & Baron (2014) that focuses on the second shift and its effects on the second generation. The theoretical framework and the study’s contribution to research are also discussed.Research TopicThe study in question deals with the correlation between the second shift as well as parental professional preferences and the developments of gender stereotypes in children (Croft et al., 2014). Croft et al. (2014) hypothesize that the parent’s domestic roles and careers affected their children’s explicit and implicit beliefs concerning gender roles. It is predicted that fathers who share domestic duties and have the second shift tend to have an egalitarian view on gender roles, which is transmitted to children.Finding of the Literature Related to the Research ProblemIt is necessary to note that this study is based on the existing knowledge on the matter. Moreover, it is consistent with the findings revealed in recent research. Endendijk et al. (2013) claim that implicit and explicit beliefs and parents’ behaviors form (to a great extent) their children’s explicit and implicit beliefs on gender roles. Okimoto and Heilman (2012) stress that gender stereotypes are prevalent in the working place. It is found that working women are negatively regarded in their working place especially among male employees. These findings reveal the way gender stereotypes are developed and manifested.Research Problem and Research QuestionsThe research problem is the transmission of gender stereotypes within families. The research question (although not outlined explicitly) can be formulated as follows. Do parental explicit and implicit gender-role associations and behaviors predict their children’s professional aspirations?The Contribution the Research Made to the Knowledge Base in PsychologyIt is possible to note that the study in question has made a certain contribution to the scope of knowledge in psychology. First, the researchers explore the way parental professional preferences, as well as their gender-role associations, affect the development of gender stereotypes in their children. Croft et al. (2014) unveil an intriguing correlation between fathers’ implicit as well as explicit beliefs and behaviors and their daughters’ career aspirations.No similar trend is present in the relationships between fathers and sons or mothers and daughters. The researchers’ conclusion concerning the distribution of household duties is supported by evidence. It can be regarded as a background for further research as well as the development of particular strategies to promote egalitarian views and practices within families. Croft et al. (2014) unveil one of the mechanisms contributing to the development of stereotypes.The Theoretical Framework used in the ResearchThe study in question is mainly based on the social role theory. The central provision of the theory is that gender roles have been developing throughout history (Berscheid & Regan, 2016). These roles are distributed rather unevenly, which is a result of the development of the patriarchal society. Females are largely seen as domestic workers who focus on child-rearing and household duties. Whereas, males perform various roles within society. Another theory the researchers refer to as the social learning theory. Bandura is one of the major developers of this framework, and he stressed that children often learn the behaviors they observe.Parents are the major source of social learning at certain stages of human life. It holds it that children mainly copy their parents’ behaviors and beliefs (Berscheid & Regan, 2016). The researchers grounded their analysis on this assumption and predicted that parents’ implicit and explicit behaviors are transmitted to their children.The Contribution the Research Made to Psychological TheoriesThis study made a certain contribution to psychological theory. Mainly, it provided evidence to support existing theories. Thus, it is clear that children do copy their parents’ behaviors and beliefs. However, Croft et al. (2014) stress that boys are not as receptive as daughters are when it comes to egalitarian views and especially the behavior of their fathers. The researchers emphasize the need to explore the degree to which parents or society affects the development of gender stereotypes in males.ConclusionIn conclusion, it is possible to note that the study in question provides valuable insights into several aspects of gender stereotypes development. The researchers claim that the distribution of domestic roles affects the way gender stereotypes develop in children. The authors find a specific correlation between fathers’ explicit and implicit beliefs as well as behaviors and their daughters’ professional aspirations. The trend is not found in the relationships between fathers (or mothers) and their sons. This finding brings to the fore some questions concerning the role the family and the society play in the development of people. The researchers also conclude that the distribution of domestic roles has a significant impact on the way children develop gender stereotypes. This finding can be used to develop strategies aimed at the development of a truly egalitarian society.",1
79e57c83,0,"#Possible Career Choises Planning Review  IntroductionCareer planning entails a personal initiative pursued by an individual in order to arrive at the desired occupation of interest. It may involve situations where one visits a career counselor, career websites or seeks information from friends and family members on his/her career of interest. In this case, an individual addresses a number of questions such as: What should I major in? What can do with a major in my current course? What should my resume have? How do I search for the job I desire? What do I engage myself in for the rest of my life? These questions enable one to plan for his/her career or employment before going ahead to implement the plan. This essay entails my plan for the future career possibilities that I have in mind. It gives a detailed account of the economic rationale of each career possibility, the academic requirements of each career, and the major colleges and universities that can help me attain the academic requirements for each career possibility.Career PlanningIdentification of the Careers of ChoiceMaking reference to the LCCC and the Bureau of Labor Statistics career websites, I managed to come up with a number of career possibilities that can match my career and employment interests. These are Banking, Airline Company Financial Management and Human Resource Management among others.Economic Rationale of the Career Possibilities: Evaluation of My Career PossibilitiesThis industry provides services ranging from safeguarding money, provision of loans, payment services to insurance and investment opportunities. It can be divided into three major categories (that is) commercial banks/ Federal reserve banks, credit service unions and loans & savings organizations. Under this industry, about 64% of jobs are held by the office and the administrative officers and their support staff. Because of its large size and the high turnover rate of professionals, the office and administrative sector offers greater employment opportunities annually. Additionally, it is recorded that the banking industry had about 1.8 million employees in the wage and salary sector only. Promotions from this position into the management sector require an individual to be experienced and technically trained. Moreover, a growth rate of 8% is expected in this industry over the projection period of 2008-18 relative to 11% in other industries combined (Bureau of Labor Statistics, par.23).Most organizations, government agencies, or companies are said to employ 1-2 financial managers annually. They are charged with the duty of preparing financial reports, overseeing investments and implementing strategic plans. The industry poses stiff competition for job seekers because of its small size, additional qualifications and experience requirements. It is recorded that 3 out of 10 professionals in this industry are in the insurance and finance sectors.The industry is charged with the responsibility of attracting, training and motivating the most qualified individuals for specific jobs. Because of its diverse duties, it offers a large career opportunity for many professionals with various educational backgrounds. In addition, studies indicate that the industry is projected to record a growth rate of more than average (22%) within the period of 2008-18. In 2008 only, the industry had about 904,900 workers spread evenly in all sectors.Academic qualifications of My Career PossibilitiesA minimum requirement of high school education is needed for individuals wishing to be trained and employed in the office and administrative sectors. For those under the finance, business, investment and insurance sectors, a minimum of a college degree in the relevant field is required. Possession of good communication, interpersonal and customer relations skills is an added advantage. Sometimes background information may be required for all employees (Bureau of Labor Statistics, par.28).A bachelors’ degree in the relevant field is the minimum requirement for most positions in this industry. Possession of a masters’ degree or any other professional certifications will be an added advantage. Moreover, most managers are required to have experience in sales and loans positions or any relevant positions. For most financial managers, having excellent math, interpersonal and business skills is an important attribute for one’s career. Additional licensing and certifications are also a requirement for most financial management positions (Bureau of Labor Statistics, par.28).College graduates who are majors in human resources, industry and labor relations and administration are required to fill the most diverse positions in this industry. Because the industry is diverse, individuals with a wide range of course combinations stand a better chance of securing employment in any of the positions. These courses include social sciences, business administration, management, sciences, law and finance among others. An advanced degree will enable one to get a higher position in management. Experience, certifications, advancements, excellent communication and interpersonal skills are very important attributes within this industry (Bureau of Labor Statistics, par.12).College or University IdentificationIn order to meet the above requirements for my career choices, I managed to identify a number of colleges and universities offering courses in the three career possibilities. These are: Albany State University-School of Business Baylor University – Hankamer School of Business California State University  Anderson Graduate School of Management Boston University School of Management Clark University Graduate School of Management  Andrews University School of Business Bradley University Foster College of Business Administration California State University- Bakersfield School of Business & Public Administration Source: (Penn State, par.1-13).ConclusionThe essay has given an in-depth plan of my future career possibilities in the fields of banking, financial management, and human resource management. It comprises the various ways of identifying these career possibilities, the economic rationale of the three career possibilities, their academic requirements and the Colleges & Universities offering courses in the three career possibilities.Works CitedBureau of Labor Statistics.

These days, paraprofessionals are self-employed specialists who provide services for a specific recipient in their field or the entire community (Kirkwood, 2021). A paraprofessional describes the various roles in the industry held by individuals who assist licensed professionals with day-to-day tasks. I want to become a paraprofessional because this job provides many valuable opportunities.Regardless of the field, being a paraprofessional offers on-the-job training. I can move up the corporate ladder more quickly and get my license. I benefit from working with real-life experience in my chosen industry. My employer can be a trusted mentor to help me fit into the work environment. Moreover, working as a paraprofessional, I can quickly get a qualification. It seems like the best choice to get a job as soon as possible without wasting time with years of training.Paraprofessionals enjoy employee benefits: paid vacations and insurance programs. An important criterion for my choice is a decent salary that a paraprofessional can count on. In addition, there are many opportunities for career advancement, and therefore salary increases throughout the career. I am also attracted by the possibility of a flexible choice of future path. Paraprofessionals do not have to become narrow specialists in one area. Paraprofessionals still have promising careers, as do licensed professionals. The opinion of paraprofessionals is listened to, so I will have the opportunity to influence the situation in my area. As a paraprofessional, I will be able to gain experience that I can later apply in the development of my own business.Thus, being a paraprofessional is a great career opportunity for me. Decent salaries and the chance to gain valuable experience influenced my choice. Saving time is also essential; I can get to work very quickly and develop in the professional field. I also value the flexibility it provides: I can move from one area to another, remaining a good specialist in the whole chosen field.ReferenceKirkwood, K. (2021).

b5235eb3,0,"#College Graduates' Career Paths -    The article that this post covers was compiled by the Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS). It was done in the Summer of 2013 under Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH) in the US. The article in review for this assignment is titled “College to career: Projected job openings in occupations that typically require a bachelor’s degree.” The article’s main thesis is that having a college major has a low chance of getting one unemployed because many job openings require bachelor’s degrees. The main ideas are centered on the way graduates have higher chances of earning more than less educated people in fields such as engineering, medicine, computer science, and art. The thesis of the article is that there are many job openings that college graduates can fit in where the fields pay depending with the specialization.The author has given various evidence-based assertions regarding career paths for different college graduates. For instance, a degree holder in the business-related field is likely to be unemployed by only 9% (Bureau of Labor and Statistics, 2013). Additionally, the author has shown that humanities are likely to get one unemployed among all the disciplines. The rate of graduates who are likely to be unemployed in computer science and mathematics is less than 5%, as shown by the author in figure 1 below. According to the author, many job openings require a bachelor’s degree in the future.BLS classified the occupations depending on education, skills, and training divisions. However, each job depends on the work experience, demand, and grouping that determine the wages, training, and demand in the market. The author has given an example of about 1.5 million job openings between 2010 and 2020, where most jobs involve interacting with people such as teaching, healthcare, insurance, and sales and marketing (Bureau of Labor and Statistics, 2013). In this case, computer systems analyst jobs were projected to be about 222,500 during the same period, while actuaries have about 18,900 openings (Bureau of Labor and Statistics, 2013). Regarding earnings, engineering jobs are likely to pay higher, followed by computer science, while education and humanities take the last positions in that order.Since the article was written in 2013, many projections have come to pass. I agree that many job openings have been witnessed in the last ten years, as the author had forecasted in the article. The US unemployment rate has dropped to 3.7% for graduates except during the start of the current pandemic. The economy has significantly stabilized, giving more hope to many job seekers (Luitel & Mahar, 2022). I do not agree with the author about the annual salary for various majors as predicted.Despite engineering and computer science paying well, social sciences have also evolved. For instance, an established professional psychiatrist is likely to earn more than a software developer, depending on the specialization and network created while working (Morita, 2017). As the author suggested, experience determines how a career pays because a manager will be paid than a fresh graduate. Thus, some of the assertions by the author may not apply in the contemporary employment field. However, it is hard to dispute that cloud computing and artificial intelligence jobs are among the top openings, as well as sales leadership (Luitel & Mahar, 2022). That is relevant because the author had foreseen it and it is applying in many job openings.The article’s implication is that the employment fields are vast, which means there is an expected expansion of opportunities in the future. It also means that as time passes, many openings shall ensue in the market, especially concerning computer and digital applications. The article’s main idea can tell that the US is transforming into a more skilled country than before. The gap in research concerns the feasibility of stable job sustainability because the diversity in occupations might require one to have a special talent or skill. Thus, researchers should investigate the possible uncertainties that influence the dynamics in the upcoming job openings.",1

b854ad51,0,"#Studying and Working Balance -    Following the changing business environment and the demands at work place, the need for cash when one is at school is currently compelling people to work and at the same time they are doing/taking some courses. Balancing studies while at the same time one is in school is not an easy task; it requires one to sit down and plan his or her time so as to have sufficient time for both causes. One should be aware that the two have targets that have to be obtained for success. This paper gives an analysis of how I have managed to allocate time for working and studying; it will aim at assisting my fellow students to know the considerations that they need to make when making such a decision.Before one decides to go back to class, he should make the decision without underestimating his capabilities; what one can do should be well interpolated so as to venture in the area that one is capable of doing. If one wants to go back to school alongside his job, then he should start by having a vision of what he want to attain after the completion. Then choose a course that will lead him to the destiny that he aims to reach. If it is the case of a student, then he should be able to know the available jobs that are in line with what he can offer in terms of experience, interests, and the time that is available. The period that the study will take should be analyzed in making the decision as well as the third parties that will be affected by the decision. If for example you have realized that you have some potential in accounting; it will be more affordable if you go and start a course in accounting (Fink, p. 32).The fact that a person has decided to go back to school doesn’t make the day any longer; what will be important is to “create time” this means that the individual prioritizes the activities that he has to do in such a way that he can have extra time that he can then devote to either studies or part time job. There are some things that we may not be able to change and thus we will analyze the situation knowing that there are some hours that are already dictated. This is done by understanding the work or study schedule. The start point that I took was having the institute’s time table and the job time table then I analyzed the time that I was likely to be free. When terming a certain hour/time as free, I also allocated time for domestic attention. If there is something that can be done to schedule the time tables to fit ones need then it should be done. For example there are some days that I am supposed to work in an afternoon shift,-the same time that lessons are taking place, however it is possible to talk to my supervisor to allocate me morning shifts instead.This is more felt when one is making a decision of going back to school; he should be sure that he will raise the fees required over the entire period of study. Talking to people who have prior experience in the area of study or work is important so one can understand how demanding the job/studies are. Other than finances, there is the issue of materials that are required for the course (Harris, p. 72). Before making the decision, it’s important to be sure that the material that may be required in future will be available. We always think that we can stop doing this or that so we can have extra coins or some time; however it isn’t always as easy as it is to say. After we have created the finances and time by sacrificing something, individual efforts should be made to ensure that one lives to the promise that he has made to himself. Self discipline and self leadership is required. Those parties that you think are time wasters or money wasters are important in life but can hold as one takes a different course to education or work. Managing time is all about managing oneself, before I decided to take an extra course, there are some social activities that I left, they include playing golf an supporting an England football league team -Arsenal. This requires hard work, determination and self discipline.One may be willing to do something but may be out of reach, in terms of distance/ accessibility. With technology there is the advantage of distance learning and thus though as much as distance may not be a big issue, however it comes with its challenges. For example, when I decided to double deal studies and work, I ensured that my locality had power and network to access the internet any time I wanted to (Durand, p. 10).Life changes in terms of technology and social factors and before one takes a long term decision, there is the need to interpolate the effect that the decision will have for the current, medium, and long term life of the decision maker for example if a bachelor who undertakes classes until 9.00 at night, that will last for five years; what will be the effect of the decision if he decides to get married only three months into the program?, the result may not be favourable for the man. The above example illustrates the need to think of the future when making the decision. When planning the time that I had, I thought of when I’m expecting to get married, this is because marriage comes with responsibilities, thus I chose a course that won’t extend past the marriage date.Works Cited",1
a8d02e60,0,"#The Need for Dual-Career Planning  IntroductionThe number of families where both parents work and pursue careers is increasing. Such couples need to consider long-term goals regarding their lifestyle and distribution of housework between parents. Also, when children are born, additional scheduling is needed to accommodate all responsibilities. The primary issue is that the majority of dual-career families have not made any long-term decisions. This fact creates concerns for businesses, the government, and children.Problem StatementHousehold responsibilities, child care, and a potential room for conflicts of interest are some of the issues that should be considered by families, and these problems affect corporations because they have to plan accordingly.Stakeholder AnalysisEmployees’ goals are achieving career development, reaching professional excellence, and earning more. Corporations cherish such aspirations and reward those who perform well. However, a conflict emerges because employees have family roles besides workplace responsibilities. When a child is born, for instance, an employee may want to take a leave. Commonly, women take maternal leaves, and businesses have become accustomed to such situations. However, with the increasing number of dual-career families, paternal leaves are also becoming usual. Businesses need to change their leave policies to comply with the regulations. A more substantial issue is caused by the absence of both a working husband and wife – the company will need to fill in their positions temporarily to ensure stable work operations. The government is also a stakeholder in this context – research is needed to determine the effects of dual-career lifestyle and children’s performance at school and their involvement in illegal activities. It is evident that when both parents work, children are given less attention, which may impact their attitudes at school.AlternativesFor families, the case only suggests conducting careful planning before becoming a dual-career couple. For corporations, consideration of leave policies, flex-time, job-sharing, and other relevant rules is recommended. Research suggests that workplace characteristics impact work-family conflicts of couples that pursue careers. Development and flexibility, employee support on behalf of co-workers and supervisors, and job competence were found to be significant elements in relation to work-family issues (Kundu, Phogat, Datta, & Gahlawat, 2016). Also, there may be issues regarding societal expectations and job reconciliation – male workers returning from paternal leaves may face challenges in the workplace (Mauerer, 2018). Relationship maintenance can serve as a method for overcoming stress that results from attempting to balance work and family (Afifi, Harrison, Zamanzadeh, & Acevedo Callejas, 2020). However, couples need to attain training to apply relationship maintenance in practice.Recommended SolutionThe wants and desires of people change over time, and therefore, it is not possible to construct accurate and detailed plans regarding lifestyle in the context of dual-career preparation. Therefore, the only viable solution for couples is to maintain their relationships and support each other in overcoming stress. Corporations, besides implementing all the relevant policies, must ensure that all employees have favorable working conditions, and the workplace environment is supportive.ConclusionThe increasing number of dual-career families is posing a challenge to corporations and the government. Businesses need to manage such couples adequately while aligning their performance to organizational objectives. The government needs to analyze how dual-career pursuits impact child development. Both parents need to receive maintenance from each other to cope with stress. Corporations need to consider workplace elements that may influence dual-career couples.",1

The freedom of choice has not disappeared just because someone goes from making minimum wage to thousands of dollars a week. Teens are vulnerable at this time in their lives and can be influenced greatly, but their freedom of choice isn’t taken from them just because there are young celebrities making personal decisions. Although people believe celebrities hold a high level of responsibility in teaching values to younger generations, these celebrities got into the media business to flaunt their talents therefore a career change shouldn’t become a moral issue.Say no to plagiarism. Get a tailor-made essay on'Why Violent Video Games Shouldn't Be Banned'?Get original essayWhen people think of child stars they think of how lucky these children are; getting rich and famous for a talent they have or just by knowing certain celebrities. There was a time in each celebrity’s life when they were average people, and they would do what anyone else would do if they get paid large amounts of money for a specific talent; keep doing it. But as it is pointed out in many legend stories, too much money can change a person for the worse. In the words of Miley Cyrus “I was growing up, I didn't even notice that I started making all this money. There's something about new money that makes people change” (Blasberg). Child stars don’t create their own image for the public to see, that is what their managers do. Managers find an image to place these young stars into even if it doesn’t match them at all; it’s not about sharing the child’s values, it’s about what will make everyone involved the most money in the end. Unfortunately when these public images are made, the thought of the child getting older usually isn’t a topic that is thought about; just because they are made celebrities when they are young doesn’t mean they are immortal.Celebrities who were able to express who they are from the start are truly the lucky ones. Lady Gaga made her own image from the moment she released her first single. She is an extremist who isn’t afraid of what people have to say against her, which ended up allowing people to accept her as a whole. “Gaga, after all, was never sold to us as an innocent tween role model, and so we expect her to behave like this: to push the envelope, to use one of the more euphemistic expressions available” (Purple). What the audience expects directly determines how they will react to a certain celebrity or performance, but the behavior they accept is different for every celebrity. There is no rule book of morals people depend on when watching TV or listening to the news gossip; the opinion of a celebrity has been drawn and they are not allowed to stray from what they are supposed to be. It is also difficult for celebrities to explain their bold behavior when the goal of the media today is still to entertain, but to also take advantage of celebrities’ mishaps at the same time. Performing at the VMAs for example, started out as a way to honor celebrities who have worked hard in pleasing the public and are granted a chance to wow the live audience with a performance but now it is for “the assembled media wait breathlessly to see who will produce an “OMG” moment that can be replayed on cable news and “Good Morning America” for the next week” (Lowry).Teens are a large percentage of the audience watching these celebrities’ every move. A lot of these teens view these celebrities as the main idols in their lives, so when a celebrity chooses to change his image completely, it severely effects those teens who identified themselves by that celebrity’s previous image. Teens are vulnerable because they are in search of their identity as a person which leads directly to who they will become and “The power of the celebrity has taken control of these teens and ended with negative influences” (Gauna). With how the media has transformed from entertainment to the glorification of unhealthy habits like drug abuse, unprotected sex, and alcohol, it is not teens’ faults they accept these behaviors into their own lives. But “we're not naive enough to imagine we can fail high school, make a sex tape that goes viral and then BAM a TV crew swoops in and all of a sudden we're the stars of a hugely successful TV show. And we're certainly not dumb enough to accept what we see on screen as the gospel truth” (Keogh).It is unfortunate to think that the freedom of choice hasn’t come far enough. The value of choice has become undermined by society and the media taking hold of what they can to make the most money they can. The manipulation people are suffering from the media about what is acceptable is out of control.

There was a time in each celebrity’s life when they were average people, and they would do what anyone else would do if they get paid large amounts of money for a specific talent; keep doing it. But as it is pointed out in many legend stories, too much money can change a person for the worse. In the words of Miley Cyrus “I was growing up, I didn't even notice that I started making all this money. There's something about new money that makes people change” (Blasberg).

6d49444f,0,"#Four Employees Stages in Career Development  Employees develop their knowledge, courage, and experiences through working within a profession. Essentially, the development of employees within their professions undergoes various forms of manipulations depending on the level of experiences. Researchers present four stages which employees undergo during their transformation in an organization (Noe, 2010). The four career stages are associated to professional development where the base knowledge is attained and transformed through a process of integration. The employees master the knowledge, become autonomous in decision making, show a passionate association to the work, and become professionals in the subject field eventually. This paper discusses the four stages step-by-step in accordance with their relevance to the management of sports.Entry StageThis stage commences when an individual is hired within an organization in such positions as coaches and other trainers. In this stage, the employees are usually dependent on other people in order to understand the process in which an organization functions. Skills are attained as time passes since the employee attains the basic information and culture surrounding their operations. A person gets relevancy of his or her training, becomes creative, shifts from dependency to independency, explores individual dynamics, boosts the prevailing knowledge, and develops a social community around him or her (Oosterhof, 2011). Furthermore, some organizations orient the employees and mentor them in order to facilitate flow of efficacy to all people. Essentially, the entry stage is the most fundamental part in which the employees within the sports’ management are welcomed to a great community relaying distinct virtues. In perspective, this stage can motivate a new employee to work and achieve certain standards of an organization. Similarly, the employee may be discouraged at this stage when he or she realizes that the working conditions and procedures are unsatisfactory. In sports management, Damico (2009) indicates that there has been reliable development where this stage introduces the employees to a tradition of striving to become winners. This author points out that this aspiration continues to motivates the employees and other people within sports to achieve greatly.The Colleague StageThis stage has been approved as a potential level of satisfaction where responsibilities increases as leadership titles expand (Noe, 2010). At this level, people belong to a professional community where ideas are made through participation at equal level of acknowledgement. The individuals contribute to the progress of the group or organization in an independent manner. The professionals develop knowledge, independence, and autonomous features (Stack, 2013). The individuals with this form of complexity demand formal training and proper working conditions. They are able to fight for their rights and criticize actions that do not align with their expectations. They develop expertise, contribute to decision-making, elevate their efficacy, become creative, and develop into a state of interdependency. The organization provides them with the opportunity to improve their specialty. In most cases, these employees are included in the committees, professional associations, sharing of information, counseling, and formation of informative reading materials (Lussier, 2012). Since sporting is areas of recreation, the jovial moments of becoming winners is accompanied by many other benefits where income is attained. The ideas developed by these employees determine how work income arises due to these events. They facilitate the making of a brand that can be applied to earn through sales, marketing, donations, and payments among many other aspects (Ghosh, 2010).Counselor StageThe employees become professional with the capabilities to handle formal and informal tasks for the benefit of the organization (Noe, 2010). They are able to develop the organizational goals as well as improve their personal attributes. Essentially, the people in this level are able to hold various professional duties in different organizations (Marcus, Simkin, Rossi, & Pinto, 2010). They have broad-based expertness that enables them to address complex and overlapping issues through proper management. These professionals can counsel other employees and establish coaching relations. Their expansion of knowledge continues to improve at this stage. In sport management, these professionals provide counsel for reliable progress and advise other people in achieving the most reliable outcomes.Advisor StageThis stage of professional complexity shapes the way an organization can develop. They are experienced with expertise from different field where they have worked. Essentially, these people do not have single titles since they hold managerial and professional qualifications and to guide and relay insight (Mwaanga, 2010). They are at a level where responsibilities are many. This aspect implies that they can influence large population of people. They approve the plans developed in their watch. Essentially, they hold all the experiences attained from the initial entry stage. In this light, they are counselors and planners who influence the sole existence of other workers.ConclusionEmployees are segmented depending on their integration to the organizational setting. The development commences once an employee is hired until he or she becomes an acknowledged advisor. The stages involve intensive learning and attainment of knowledge. The working strengths and capabilities to handle responsibilities increases as the employee work within an organization. This form of employee development is a key reason why sports management retains employees within their organization. Essentially, these employees hold the secrets of management within the subject organization in sports.",1
a14531f4,0,"#Emirati Career Choice: Educational & Other Factors -   IntroductionThe Emirati is a very interesting group of people of Arab ethnicity. They actually constitute the families that rule in the dynasties in the United Arab Emirates. These groups of people can be traced to have originated from the Bani Yas clan. Nonetheless, there are some other groups from outside that have been integrated into the Emirati community. The first institute of higher learning in the United Arab Emirates was the establishment of the UAE University in 1977. This university has been very significant in this fast-growing nation. The university was set to allow the young Emirati to be able to attain better and higher education needs as well as enhance the culture of the Emirati Community and the entire Arab society at large. While making an effort to prepare future leaders and workers, higher education in the country still faces problems of cultural, ethical, professional, and societal origin that seem to be very complex. These have actually slowed the pursuit of education by many of the young Emirati men. This paper shall address the factors that have affected career choices among young Emirati men. Specific focus will be on the educational and environmental aspects. The focus group is young men in the university; the second year to fourth who fall below the age of 25 years.Educational and Environmental Factors That Influence Emirati Young Men Career ChoicesThe unemployment rate in the United Arab Emirates is about 12 percent and this is suspected to be even higher among the Emirati Young people (Holland, 1997). This is a very big deal since it may affect the future policymakers when addressing the community’s social problems. A research conducted by the international security revealed that council many young people are not actively involved in employment while the few that are in some form of employment prefer doing business (Fox, 2007). By assessing the social links between the unemployment rates, it very important for the study to highlight ion the educational factors that could be behind the trend while also addressing the impact that environment has had on the same ( Archer, et al 2003). Problems of unemployment due to societal ills often cause public and international security anxieties (Findlow, 2005).Research on career choices is supposed to address a number of questions that are of interest with regard to the young Emirati men. Education and environment is very critical in that kind of study (Forstenlechner, 2010). Basically there is also need to address the issues of governance as well. Labor market and the role of culture, role of government and what individual felt about education and getting employment (Holland, 1997). On the social and expressive factors, many young men, about 58% are actually frustrated; feel insecure or depressed by the unemployment situation. Similar results have been the same for university student who say they would feel resentful if they ended up unemployed. Young men are increasingly facing pressure from the society to try sand find employment while at the same time the feel that there are very limited choices in the labor market (Holland, 1997).Educational FactorsThe education system in UAE which these young men go through has been accused of not preparing them well enough to face the challenges in the fast developing world. Many people feel that more Arab and English should be taught in universities and high school levels (Findlow, 2005). Communication can be a problems considering that Emirati young men hold their culture in high regard as it is the norm of the society of which they are part, to focus on religion, learn and master Arab culture. This means that they do not pay enough attention to English or consider it less important. However a greater percentage of young men have noted that their insufficient prowess in English language would greatly influence they employability (Findlow, 2005). It’s evident that in the current world, English has become a de facto language for official use whether it’s in office employment, business, or scientific research; most of the operations are conducted in English (Rees, et al 2007). There is often a problem for f foreigners to master English and even the native English speakers to struggle and achieve fluent English.With greater advancement in technology and research investments, There is a concern that the non-English speaking people in Asia and Gulf could be discriminated from scientific knowledge and cannot therefore competitively participate and enjoy the shared knowledge made available by science. English more convenient for use in science support its use with basis of its practicality and efficiency (Holland, 1997).Another important educational factor is the job market. Over the past 10 to 5 years, there has been a very strong campaign by employment advisors and employers for graduate jobs. This was stimulated by the fact that the choices for university were totally mismatched with the labor market available (Archer, et al 2003). For instance, it’s been observed that from the year 2000 to the year 2003, there was a big increase in the number of student who studied education, arts and religion (Holland, 1997). This in fact was a bout two thirds of the entire student population in the higher education. The remaining fraction chose to study other career lines like medicine, engineering and other technical sciences. Over the past decade or so, the students have not been making good choices since they considered higher education as a factor of social class rather than to earn economic worth, regardless of the fact that the income thereafter was a very crucial motivator for switching jobs. Some few Emirati young men even regard it as a way of escaping boredom at home (Archer, et al 2003).It’s very important to increase the scope of studies in the universities so that the student can have the relevant skills for the job market. This has however been defended on grounds that the new job demands were not in existence ten years ago so educators could not invest in such skills at higher levels (Toledo, 2006). Since the inception of the first university in 1977, many universities have proliferated across UAE. There has been an increase in the number of people with post-high school education. A Variety of fields to study have also been introduced in the recent past (Archer, et al 2003). This means that the choice or career will depend on the skills acquired and the market availability. The choices are so diverse since many fields are available. However, many young Emirati men when asked why they attended university colleges, an overwhelming 43 percent responded that they just wanted to learn something new while a 26 percent went to college in anticipation of better employment. 0ne percent said they just needed something do so as to be busy (Godwin, 2006).Attaining practical skills is as very important factor in education. This is also related to career advice from employers. Many young men feel that after college they need to be employed in the public sector. They also express a lot of criticism for many factors concerned in the private industry (Rees, et al 2007). The private sector is perceived to be offering lower wages and that there was very low job security with extended working hours (Archer, et al 2003). This means that many young men studied coursed they closely associated with public ventures and this in turn would affect their career choices in future (Godwin, 2006). Few of the people would opt to go to the private sector only when the working conditions are improved – salaries were high, flexible or shorter hour of work and provision of training programs. It’s also important to note that greater motivation would come from government when in emphasizes on education, training programs and creation of more job opportunities (Pines, 2003).Environmental FactorsThere are several factors that influence career choices fro Emirati young men. Basically the Emirati society was not very enthusiastic in advancement of education (Forstenlechner, 2010). This is attributed to the type of lifestyles that they have been leading. Some grow up and attend school with family responsibilities on their shoulders and hence focus on the careers that would be less demanding of their time. However there are several ways in which people have been observed to transform from college education into employment (Findlow, 2005). The Emirati young men are considered to be very conventional people. As a result, they make their career choices based on four basic characteristics: self efficiency – this is questioning whether they will be able to handle the tasks; outcome expectation – this is assessment of what would be the consequences of entering such a job; goals – these are questions like “what do I want to achieve in life” and contextual support and Drawbacks – these are actually the societal effects that one would have to deal with (Archer, et al 2003).Self efficacy aspect can be linked to self-concept which can further be narrowed to career choice. Some people believe that they cannot do certain careers since they are very demanding. The contextual drawbacks and supports can be described as factors of cognitive career choice – preconditioning. Many young men are unable to venture into careers that they have not information about. This also relates to the consequences expected (Pines, 2003). This means that few people would want to venture into new field otherwise the majority will prefer studying the courses that have existed for so long and proceed directly to careers very familiar.Career counseling is a strong factor that influences young people in their choices. Currently UAE lacks a sound system that is market – oriented to assist young people from universities. This has made the transition from universities to job market very complicated for the young men to cope up with. The lack of proper guidance can aggravate the problem more if not corrected in time (Crabtree, 2007). Essentially many young men make their choices for degree programs because of the influence from peers and family. Students are hence limited in their capacity to follow dreams and make independent decisions. Basically advices from non qualified individuals tend to incline towards what they hear in regular (Pines, 2003). Currently everybody is talking about Information technology and hence the number young people enrolling for IT are overwhelmingly high. Many young men have impracticable expectations of the career market.The jobs market as its be identified is a great factor in career choice since its also common sense that one cannot choice venturing into a career that is non-existent and expect to be employed. The commerce sector in the United Arab Emirates attracts many young men; this is because many of the young people have ambition of entering entrepreneurship or getting employed on family business (Crabtree, 2007). Many of the young as cited prefer government jobs rather that from private firms. This could be a problem of unrealistic expectations that the young men have acquired to enter the job market (Godwin, 2006).Misinformation leading to preconditioning is also a major environmental problem. Many people are currently investing degrees that would lead them to IT and e-commerce sectors because they think that these industries have very strong demands. They fail to realize that in a short while, these fields will be totally saturated. This means that many young people are not considering what they do as career selection but rather as work just for convenience (Pines, 2003).Culturally, UAE is still young, modern and a fast developing nation. The country has embraced the latest technology and its advancement is evident in almost every aspect. However being an Islamic country, incorporating the western influence has often been a setback since Islam and the west do not mix. Furthermore the Emirati society is deeply rooted in their culture and the heritage from their founding fathers (Crabtree, 2007). They also hold strong stance on religion regarding Islam as a strong faith. These beliefs are very critical to the daily lives of the Emirati young men. This is because Islam is somehow patriarchal and the men will hold strong stands in religion. This can affect their choices in life like work. However, many the go through university education think more critically. Currently the cultural factors have very little impact on the decision individuals make regarding work (Vanheule & Verhaeghe, 2005).Their General Life and Their Way of Defining PrioritiesThere have been reports that Emirati people in the Arab peninsula are very contradictory people. There are moments when the nation experience great events and incidences and times when they are hard hit (Rees, et al 2007). UAE is a not much of a victim of squandered government finances and poor policies like many developing nations. Yet, the country is making an effort to better the living standards of its residents. The effort the nation has made is great having grown from seven small impecunious regions in the desert to a modern state (Pines, 2000). With improving governance, the UAE was able to develop a diverse economy that is getting to the top of the world as one of the highest living standards. The nation depends on oil and the money generated has been used to construct very good infrastructure and to widen the scope of the nations’ economy. About half a century ago, there was not electrical grid, telephone systems, modern education centers, Indoor plumbing and public health facilities, the literacy level was only 20 percent. Very few women attended school (Pines, 2000). Currently the city of Dubai is characterized by skyscrapers. Abu Dhabi is becoming a very strong tourism and business center with great airport construction going on.Emirati seem to have mastered the concept of self-reliant very fast and are working tirelessly towards it. Investing and venturing into new areas is becoming their way of life. The vision of the UAE leaders is to make Dubai a leader in world business. Looking at the trend at which the nation is growing, and then achieving that vision can be made possible (Pines, 2000). The society which used to be patriarchal with total oppression of women is completely transforming. Men are encouraged to spend more time with their families and engage in social and community activities (Pines, 2003). Many of the men have taken the initiative to help in house hold duties and encourage women to attend school, college and enter the job market (Toledo, 2006). The domestic duties can be shared since the conventional way of life in which only the man was a sole bread winner is fading away. Many women are getting degrees and increasing competitiveness of the country.Women are no longer appreciated just as wives and mothers but also as prospective leaders. As the country moves forwards, so should the women. Emirati leaders believe that in the modern economy, men and women should be equal partners. However there is a very big challenge considering the fact that even in the western nations where women empowerment begun long ago has not been able to attain the perfect compromise (El-Sanabary, 2002).The Emirati young men have in the past lacked motivation to study or work harder get employment. Many young men still do not see the need for college education. Some individuals in fact simple aspire to be silent partners to the foreign business that are being set up in UAE (Knight, 2006). It’s very difficult to inspire the need for education and improvement of ones credentials in a nation that is increasingly being seduced by subsidies. Currently, young Emirati men are presented with better study and working conditions; free education, better pay, short and flexible working hours and healthcare. Regardless of the government effort – Emiratization – to infuse the young Emirati into the market, very few people are seen to rise up to the challenge. In terms of technology, as much as the government is encouraging its use, many people still do not have the skills for competitive venture. Family has been a priority for the Emirati men though recently that has changed to a more balanced lifestyle (Pines & Yanai, 2001).Men set their priorities differently. Some put their business first while others have been observed to extend more to family. This at times affects their work or studies. Family businesses are very common and are always passed on the next generation as they grow to form very large business empires. The major facto the influence priorities is friends and family (Crabtree, 2007). It’s been noted that families that believe strongly in business usually tend to get their children study business oriented degrees so that they can be back in business more productive. This limits choices for the said children. The families that still oppress women will see men not participate in the bringing up of the family. Family structure of Emirati is mostly extended though nuclear ones are often complete (Pines & Yanai, 2001). Children are only expected to leave their household when marrying. Housing is within a compound surrounded by walls. Their staple food is rice.The Reason of Choosing Their MajorA critical moment in university education is when it comes to choosing a major. There are several researchers that have been carried out in UAE to investigate how the university students selected their major (Burt, 2007). As it has already been highlighted in the preceding text that the nation does not have proper system of career advisory body, student face tough moment in finding relevant majors for what they hope to do I future career wise. In one such research carried out by Gallacher and other asked students to create a list of four majors they would like to pursue: They were also asked to list some of the factors that lead to their choices of the majors. Surprisingly enough, about half of the students who participated in the research gave only one choicer of a major. They explained that they would have known the major they wanted before joining the university (Gallacher, et al 2010).Personal interest was a major factor that was listed to influence the choices compared to family which is believed to be very influential (El-Sanabary, 2002). Previous researchers had indicated that job availability, wage level, social status of the job and family were more influential that personal interest. On the assessment of who had the greatest control over their choices about 75 percent of the participants indicated that a member of their family, though many of the student had attended career presentations before. Parent had greater influence especially the fathers (Gallacher, et al 2010). Friends were least on the ranking. The dependence on family on critical decision is seen to be even across a number of culture but more consistent among the Emirati community.Having the awareness of the various majors is very important in decision making since with limited knowledge the decision is definitely limited. It’s interesting that the best known major that one can pursue is business. Over 70 percent of students can confidently mention it. Many students only know of few majors while some knew only one (Gallacher, et al 2010). The majors that indicate lower awareness among the student in UAE include international studies and Medical fields (Health sciences). It’s also worth noting that those students who knew about such uncommon majors were likely to specialize in these categories like pursuing political science of nutrition. Some specializations like education, law and engineering were hardly considered. Information technology is currently increasing in awareness (Crabtree, 2007). This means that the choice of majors could be limited by awareness problem since many students only know of business and art.Perception of the majors is also an important influence. Basically the choice would be based on the perceived ease of finding a job, salary expectations and the social position such a career holds in the society (Burt, 2007). Business is usually preferred by the young Emirati men due to t he ease of finding a job after college and the salary expectation (Vanheule & Verhaeghe, 2005). Second to it, is the international studies, this however receive most selection due to its social ranking. Despite the students following their interests, it’s evident that this is swayed by discernment that business offered a broader category for the preferred job (Gallacher, et al 2010).ConclusionCareer choice for young individual is a very important decision in life since of the choices made end up being a lifetime investment. This therefore means that before a choice is made, the young individual should be well informed about it and should be able to integrate other related factors. The decision should basically meet the personal needs and interest because career is something that one has to live with the rest of his life. However id based on other people opinion, it could end up being very frustrating. Its proper to listen to advice from family and friends even consider what the whole society says but the ultimate decision should be based on individual assessment of all the factors that are related to the career choice. Interest, ability to do the job and satisfaction should guide such decisions.ReferenceAl Ali, J.

What is a career fair? A career fair is when people with different careers/career pathways explain information about their career to students so they can begin planning what they want to do. Some of the speakers that presented were from science, communication, and business pathways and all had interesting explanations however, the most interesting was the Human Services career pathway. To begin, the Human Services career pathway includes many different occupations. For example, the Human Services speaker at the career fair, Mike Wieland, was a probation officer. As a probation officer, he would supervise offenders who are on probation. Another example is a psychologist, who is someone that gives people a safe environment to express their feelings and helps people with struggles or problems they are having.

Much more is involved than simply determining what a person intends to do for a career. It’s crucial to conduct an extensive study and be aware of possibilities before choosing future employment. For this review, I have selected three of the most perspective career choices: a registered nurse, an engineer, and a database administrator.Registered NurseRegistered nurses are healthcare experts who examine patients physically, document their medical records, and deliver medicine and therapy. Additionally, they advise their patients and educate them about their treatment options. A recurring issue in the nursing field is the dearth of qualified nursing professors (Gazza, 2018). It lowers the number of nurses qualified to deliver secure, high-quality care in various environments. As a result, there is a huge demand for registered nurses in the labor market, and a decent income is guaranteed.EngineerTo design and construct an engine or mechanism, engineers use their understanding of science and arithmetic. The community of requirements engineers recently acknowledged the growing demand for highly skilled specialists in the engineering profession (Daneva et al., 2017). They seek to address a range of issues by using scientific findings. In addition, they plan tests, prepare budgets, create project requirements, and make that each engineering project is completed on schedule and within the allocated budgeted costs, among other things.Database AdministratorIn a number of sectors, database administrators manage an organization’s database. This includes overseeing the database’s development, assuring its functionality, and keeping an eye on its cybersecurity. Database administrators are responsible for implementation, configuration, and maintenance, in addition to storing and managing datasets. Any organization’s data is a commodity that must be secured while still being accessible to the enterprise (Peasland, 2019). Therefore, database administrators are vital and highly-demanded specialists in every corporate setting.Because it determines how individuals will spend years of their lives, the decision-making process for a career includes option research and justification. Three career options were briefly reviewed in this paper. To conclude, engineers, registered nurses, and database administrators are highly-demanded positions that require competence, expertise, and education.",1

By expanding on Becker’s rational choice theory Hakims sets out to disprove what she considers widely held feminist myths.

McRae paperCarries out empirical research on women’s views on work and home to test preference theory. Builds on Hakims study by adding another dimension to Hakim’s arguments: “Instead it is argued that a complete explanation of women’s labour market choices, depends as much on understanding the constraints that differentially affect women as it does on understanding their personal preferences” (McRae 2003:318) “Although support is found for Hakim’s argument that employment careers are centrally important for only a minority of women, Little evidence is adduced that it is preference that distinguish the minority from the majority” (McRae 2003:317).Women who have similar preferences may not necessarily have the same market position in terms of employment. There are other factors to consider, which can cause inequality: education, social capital, class, ethnicity,…show more content…Even if men and women made equal career and life choices, equality of opportunity does not always equal equality of outcome as people are heterogeneous and have different negative and positive inequalities to contend with. A sociological study carried out by the University of Leicester revealed that high earning career committed men would not mind earning less if they were able to spend more time with family. “58 per cent of male breadwinners - those who earned more than their partners - were more likely to want to spend more time at home, and 15 per cent wanted to work longer” (Kanji cited by Trueman 2015)So perhaps the choice between family and career is not a gender issue but a ‘nature of work’ issue whereby society does not have the time proportions of work and life correctly balanced to enable people to enjoy and achieve",1

4bae5a5b,0,"#Becoming a Professional in Your Career  IntroductionMany people struggle to find a career they want to pursue. Some of them succeed to do so, while others fail. Without any doubt, it is critical to choose the right job and make an effort to become a professional. Otherwise, individuals may suffer from a discontent with life, poverty, and demotivation to set new goals and achieve them. Fortunately, I clearly understand who I aim to be in the future and work diligently to turn my long-held dream into reality. Therefore, I am currently working as a dental assistant and studying for a dental hygienist to become a leading professional.Main bodyTo begin with, I am aware of the skills required for a successful dental hygienist and invest much time in developing them. For example, each professional should possess technical abilities and knowledge to perform effectively in the workplace. Making the most of my studying process, reading nonfiction books, and searching for different visuals help me advance technical skills and become more confident. Furthermore, interpersonal skills are crucial for any employee in a dental office, where interactions with patients play an essential role. Developing interpersonal skills is a gradual and complicated process, but I genuinely enjoy it. In addition, every dental hygienist must be attentive to details, as one unsterilized tool can lead to many adverse consequences.What is more, it is vital to emphasize the benefits, which can be acquired by being a dental hygienist, as they motivate me to work harder. Competitive pay is one of the most considerable advantages of this profession. Undoubtedly, if individuals earn enough money, they live better lives, as they are less concerned about financial issues but concentrate more on personal and career development. A dental hygienist also holds a position with numerous opportunities for further advancement. Hence, it is always possible to take new responsibilities and earn more. Moreover, “job prospects are expected to be relatively good as the number of openings in this occupation is projected to exceed the number of graduates from dental hygiene programs” (Occupational Outlook Handbook). Besides, dental hygienists have the opportunity to work in a people-oriented environment, which creates a friendly and happy atmosphere.Furthermore, I intend to explain why I am convinced that a dental hygienist’s career is the one for me. First, I possess extensive knowledge of dental hygiene and have experience working in the dental office with true professionals. Knowledge is essential for any specialist who always needs to improve them. It has never been a problem for me to learn new information on dental hygiene or oral health in general. The reason for it is that I take pleasure in the process of discovering further information and observing its implementation in the dental office. Fortunately, I often have the opportunity to discuss different dental issues with my colleagues and put my knowledge into practice. Therefore, I have realized that I have extraordinarily good technical abilities and expertise, which are critical requirements for a successful dental hygienist.Second, I can handle different individuals and possess remarkable interpersonal skills. Communication is essential for dental hygienists, who have to listen actively, educate patients, adapt to their unique personality traits, and be ethical and empathetic. They must also “be considerate in working with patients, especially with those who are sensitive to pain or who have fears about undergoing dental treatment” (Occupational Outlook Handbook). I have developed excellent interpersonal skills by volunteering and aim to improve them in the future, as they are critical in the modern world. Undoubtedly, I enjoy interacting with different individuals and finding ways to approach each of them. Therefore, I am eager to face the challenge of interacting with different patients and successfully deal with it.Third, I have an all-consuming passion for being a leading dental hygienist. For example, while working as a dental assistant, I often come in early, stay late, and take extra tasks. I highly appreciate working hand-in-hand with a dental hygienist, who shares his knowledge and experience. Without any doubt, spending time in the dental office is not just about my job but also about the way of life I desire to live. However, I want to take more responsibilities, be able to interact with patients independently, and solve different problems. Therefore, I invest most of my free time in gaining knowledge and experience, which will help me to turn my vision of becoming a successful dental hygienist into reality.ConclusionIn conclusion, I can state that the career of a dental hygienist is the one for me. I possess many skills required for this profession. The benefits, which are possible to acquire, motivate me to study for a dental hygienist harder and work as a dental assistant more diligently. My extraordinarily good technical skills and interpersonal skills prove that I have made the right choice regarding my future profession. Besides, my great passion inspires me to make the most of each opportunity and move towards my professional goal.Work CitedOccupational Outlook Handbook.

494d3862,0,"#Career Services: Types and Options -    Resume ReviewThe selected option offers complimentary resume samples and reviews. The significance of one’s resume is introduced in the service summary, noting the emphasis that employers place on the set of candidates’ qualifications (American Public University, n.d.). In that way, having the necessary credentials can prove ineffective if the information is not presented appropriately. For the same reason, the offered service is one of the most beneficial as a successful career strategy. Moreover, the option provides videos and writing guides as additional support for delivering the best resume.Job BoardsNext, the job boards option includes a selection of university-sponsored career opportunities to review. This step is crucial for identifying the most suitable job from the set of available ones, as not all theoretical preferences will suffice practically. Since the selection is university-sponsored, this suggests a professionally approved board. Moreover, the rest of the career-oriented services will not be relevant unless a fitting job offer is found first. In this job-seeking process, there are several factors to consider, such as location, schedule, and approximate payment details. In the end, the candidate’s interest in a work deal is just as essential as the employer’s requirements.InterviewsUltimately, the interviews services propose mock interviews as a test prior to the real meeting with an employer. This option was chosen because job interviews often serve as the final assessment of a candidate’s set of skills and abilities. Hence, this step follows from the previously mentioned processes of job searching and submitting a resume. In the case of a successful interview, the interviewer will most likely recommend the interviewee to become an employee. Therefore, a mock interview can contribute to a higher probability of working in the desired field by highlighting the candidate’s strengths and weaknesses, and the main issues to be resolved before the actual meeting.ReferenceAmerican Public University.

5071099c,0,"#Job Search and Challenges Encountered -    Having a stable job is one of the desired achievements by many people. This is because they admire living a life of satisfaction, leisure, and happiness. Some job opportunities come with added advantages such as retirement saving plans, insurance, and overtime payment. However, the procedure of seeking these employments can be cumbersome and time-wasting. This paper critically analyzes the challenges encountered in the job-searching process and possible solutions to overcome them.Having no connections can be one of the most significant obstacles whereby the availability of a referral person increases one’s chances of being employed. Additionally, rampant corruption levels may hinder one from opportunities as they may be asked to pay massive amounts of money to be recruited. Lacking confidence while in interviews may make one tense, which could portray a negative image to the potential employer. Thus, confidence is a skill that is valued for better job performance.Having no clear set goals can also contribute to difficulty in job security. Some people may opt to drop out of their employment to find new ones due to pressure and other minor problems in the workplace. This makes them move from one position to another without focus. The stiff competition where employers choose to employ the best-performing personnel leaving out the less experienced is another issue. Additionally, failing to make frequent follow-ups after applying for jobs could also deny the job-seeker a chance of service. Another challenge is a lack of knowledge regarding the proper channels for employment where other considerations are not taken into account after the submission of online applications.Therefore, to cope with these challenges, one must be confident and do frequent follow-ups after making an application. Establishing good relationships with people can create more connections making it easy to be employed. The applicant should have clearly set goals and a positive sense of direction in the job they are seeking. They must also ensure that they are competent and offer their best to give them first priorities. To eradicate corruption, the students must take their roles to sensitize the public on the effects of engaging themselves in such inappropriate and unethical behavior. This will warrant a better and more genuine way of assessing jobs.",1

Since the aim of social work is to improve people’s living conditions and provide support for the fulfillment of their needs, the professional in this field deals with highly challenging situations on a daily basis.

In this paper, the general overview of the importance of evidence-based practice will be presented. It will be followed by the discussion of the three levels of theories, including theoretical frameworks and perspectives, mid-level theories, and practice theories and models. After that, a more detailed analysis of some theory’s application in micro-and macro-practice. Finally, some concluding points and recommendations will be given in the summary.Professional Knowledge BaseProfessional knowledge is decisive for any type of work and is an obligatory requirement for a specialist in any field of activity. However, the extent, to which the intellectual abilities and expertise in the theoretical and practical aspects of the profession are important in social work, indicates the necessity to address the core elements of its knowledge base. The theoretical basis of social work practice is presented by a number of approaches, according to which one chooses a direction to the effective solution (Langer & Leitz, 2015).The work with people’s problems and needs requires critical thinking and reflection; it is complicated due to the ambiguity of the possible decisions, on which the ultimate quality of clients’ lives depends (Marlowe, Appleton, Chinnery, & Van Stratum, 2015). The link between theory and practice in social work is created by evidence-based practice (EBP).Therefore, when making a choice of the direction in which the work will be done, a social practitioner only utilizes “empirically-based treatment” that lies within the framework of EBP (Gambrill, 2007, p. 447). According to Drisco and Grady (2015), EBP is a decision-making process that requires a practitioner to “integrate the best research evidence available with their professional expertise and with client attributes, values, preferences, and circumstances” (p. 274). Moreover, the implementation of any intervention should be justified by the Code of Ethics that prioritizes the benefits of a client (Gambrill, 2007). Thus, evidence-based practice is the main direction in social work that grounds on the evidential proofs of the application of particular interventions which are validated by positive results.The multifaceted practice of a social worker is bound to intervention choice, validation, and implementation, as well as direct delivery of the services to clients. The communication with people in treatment has been documented over the years, thus creating a scope of case records, which contribute to the EBP and the ethical validations of the work (Reamer, 2005). The access to the previously obtained practical experiences of the predecessors creates a competent assessment, planning, service delivery, supervision, and accountability of the work, which are of critical importance for ethically valid social practice.According to Reamer (2005), prior documentation as an element of research provides “risk-management standards designed to enhance the delivery of services to clients and protect practitioners in case they have to defend themselves against ethics complaints” (p. 328). Therefore, theories and their practical implementation through the application of EBP construct a core professional knowledge base in social work.Primary Social Work TheoriesAny practical intervention in social service is based on a theory that predetermines the direction of thought and decision-making regarding the circumstances, values, and preferences of a client. The social work theoretical framework is divided into three levels of influence on practice, including theoretical frameworks and perspectives, mid-level theories, and practice theories and models. The first level embraces frameworks and perspectives, which are the broadest systems of ideas that shape the point of view on a particular issue.For example, a practitioner might choose a person-in-environment perspective, problem-centered practice, or strengths perspective as a general framework, within which a cease will be viewed (Langer & Leitz, 2015). Although this level of theory might be used for practice settings, it still has some limitations, including the difficulty of measurement, challenging consistent implementation, and evaluation.The second level embodies mid-level theories which are narrower than perspectives and provide an opportunity for a more specific application in a particular practice setting. These theories include crisis theory, cognitive theory, family systems theory, behaviorism, and others, which clearly define the direction in which a social worker should perform, thus providing more practical implications (Langer & Leitz, 2015). It is not difficult to define and assess the theories of this level in contrast to perspectives. However, they cannot be applied throughout practice settings.The third level of social work theories incorporates practice models, which have a direct implication on the immediate application to work. While perspectives and mid-level theories are broad guides leading to practice, models provide immediate practical directions and “offer almost a how-to manual for social workers regarding what to say and do in specified client situations” (Langer & Leitz, 2015, p. 10). Such models as solution-focused brief therapy or motivational interviewing enhance consistent practice implementation and its evaluation but can be applied only to a particular population or setting.Application of Theories to Micro PracticeSome of the overviewed theories have been applied in micro practice at the first field placement, which is Silverado Hospice in San Diego, CA. The micro practice is essential to social work and involves direct services provided for individuals and their families with regard to the particularities of a case (Austin, Anthony, Knee, & Mathias, 2016). Since the hospice is specializing in end-of-life care provision, social workers are required to apply cultural awareness, interdisciplinary knowledge, and a wide range of related skills to “address psychosocial needs of patients and their families” (Murty, Sanders, & Stensland, 2015, p. 12). The two theories that informed micro practice at Silverado include humanism theory and family systems theory.Humanism theory prioritizes the self-worth and value of the life of every person (Langer & Leitz, 2015). This theory is widely used at the Silverado hospice in the work of social practitioners with each patient individually. The communication with each client is carried out in a manner that respects an individual’s dignity and human rights. Since the facility provides care for diverse populations, the variety of services meets the needs and requirements of every client. Respectful and supporting relationships with the residents of the hospice are key to the philosophy of the organization.Families of the patients in end-of-life care units encounter significant psychological difficulties related to coping with the suffering of their loved ones and grieving after death. The task of a social worker is to address the needs of family members to eliminate adverse outcomes and foster healthy recovery after long-term treatment or loss (Curtis et al., 2016). At Silverado, family systems theory is applied in a manner that enables the inclusion of family members in the process of support in treatment according to end-of-life care. Extensive work with families allows Silverado staff to enhance the comfort of the patients, as well as provide support for the caregivers who are exposed to challenging psychological circumstances.Application of Theories to Macro PracticeSocial workers are expected to perform not only within the micro practice level but also in macro practice that incorporates activities and initiatives implemented within organizations and policies. According to Reisch (2016), the macro practice has emerged as an essential part of social work with the advances in globalization and organizational development. Therefore, it is critical for social practitioners to widen the scope of their influence and address global social issues with the help of communities and organizations. The following two theories informed macro practice at the Silverado hospice: critical theory and ecological systems theory.The leadership at Silverado cooperates with large organizations of federal and state levels to implement social change on a larger scale. According to critical theory, the social workers at Silverado carry out services for each client in accord with his or her specific requirements, needs, and expectations without any oppression or discrimination (Langer & Leitz, 2015). The participation of the hospice in inter-organizational and national programs provides an opportunity to exemplify its achievements in the field of social work for the elderly and encourage others to do the same.Ecological systems theory relates to the perception of the patterns in human behavior as a result of the influence of the environment (Langer & Leitz, 2015). Therefore, due to the fact that Silverado is often awarded for its achievements in the work with patients in end-of-life facilities, it is entitled to demonstrate its findings and practice implications. The hospice applies its achievements to change the environment to a more favorable one that enhances comfort for critically ill patients.Evaluation of ApproachIn conclusion, the professional knowledge base for social work is comprised of theories and research that form the basis for the practical implementation of service. While perspectives and mid-level theories provide broader directions for the choice of framework for future services, models supply step-by-step practical guidance for a social worker to apply in a particular setting. However, according to Adams, Matto, and LeCroy (2009), the EBP approach has its limitations related to the connection of EBP to its medical application. Also, one of the significant limitations of EBP is its high requirements for the practitioners’ skills in evidence retrieval, the development of which takes a lot of time and effort but obscures the speed of intervention implementation.The approach utilized at Silverado is beneficial due to its high level of evidential support, orientation on both micro and macro practices, as well as the aspirations to meet the needs of everyone in the diverse population. However, the scope of influence of the organization on the community and other entities could be enhanced by the application of appropriate theories. Among the recommendations for the agency, it is suggested to employ the ecological systems theory in macro practice more broadly to initiate a shift in the national policies concerning equity in end-of-life services that would allow for non-discriminative support-oriented practice that has been successfully used at Silverado.",1

Young people form many of their attitudes about work and careers as a result of interactions with the family. Family background provides the basis from which their career planning and decision making evolve. However, within each family, the level of involvement can vary, offering both positive and negative influences. This Digest examines the research on family influences on career development and describes implications for practice.The Influence of Family Background""Family background factors found to be associated with career development include parents' socioeconomic status (SES), their educational level, and biogenetic factors such as physical size, gender, ability, and temperament"" (Penick and Jepsen 1992, p. 208). In a study of the influences on adolescents' vocational development reported by Mortimer et al. (1992), the variable that had the most effect on educational plans and occupational aspirations was parental education.Mortimer et al. also report that parents with postsecondary education tend to pass along its importance to their children-a finding supported by other studies. Montgomery (1992) notes that females talented in math viewed their career choices as reflective of interests that stemmed from early family influence and educational opportunities. Marso and Pigge (1994) found that the presence of teachers in the family was a significant factor influencing teacher candidates' decisions to teach. DeRidder (1990), however, points out that lower levels of parent education can retard adolescents' career development.

86555549,0,"#Career Plan: Business Management -    IntroductionIn career planning there are four steps or processes that are followed. These include self-assessment where one has to evaluate themselves to find out what they want with their lives. This includes their interests, values, skills and developmental needs. Secondly one has to assess available options to ensure that they will get opportunities to practice their skills after completing their training. The third process is matching where one may identifies possible occupations and compare various alternatives. This can be done by comparing their short and long term options. Finally, one has to take action whereby they have to put into use the other three steps to make sure that achieve their set goals.BodyMy career vision is to provide efficient leadership to business people on how to manage their businesses. This means that I will make sure that I apply my knowledge and skills in advising people on how to succeed in their business. My career mission is to be the best business manager in my organization.A strong business manager should develop ethical values in order to earn credibility from their customers. This means that one has to be trustworthy and reasonable enough in order to advise people adequately. In fact, one should develop listening skills in order to allow clients adequate time to present their cases. This will guide them in making a decisive conclusion hence helping them run their businesses best.In order for one to achieve their goals they need to identify their competition. This is extremely significant because people plan on handling competition in order to achieve their goals. In fact, one should be able to carry out research on business operating environment in order to come up with strategies of achieving their goals.One has to balance their internal characteristics and external requirements in order to succeed. This is tremendously beneficial because one has to be tolerance to their competitors by practicing fair competition. This helps organization to run their operations without facing conflicts from other players in the business environment. In addition, one has to listen from customers in order to come up with what they want from the business firm. This means that a talented business manager should be able to prioritize issues brought about by customers and competitors, as well.Competition and cooperation plays key roles in career development. For instance, competition helps business managers to come up with best ideas to counter threats brought about by competitors. This helps them to strengthen their skills hence developing their careers. Cooperation also plays a key role in career development. This is evident because it calls for people with understanding and strong will to come together to do work.In a business management career, stakeholders may be owners of the organization. This means that a business manager should be able to relate well with owners of the organization in order to succeed in their career. In addition, customers may be stakeholders who are hugely powerful in this career. This means that their issues need to be taken carefully since they dictate the success of one’s career.Depending on the current progress, I feel that I am a future strategic leader. This is because I have been involved in planning for future in various organizations throughout my training. In fact, I have led various students’ organizations and together with members we succeeded in achieving our set goals.ConclusionIn any career, the concept of sustainability should not be ignored. This means that one has to practice all elements of sustainability which include conserving the environment. This makes sure that the organization works towards ensuring that they conserve what they have and protect the environment. A business manager should align all their business operations with environmental conservation principles.",1

The essay employs the use of several books to show what scholars think about career choices. Conversely, the essay also gives a personal opinion on industrial engineering, the career path that I have chosen.A career path is mostly a family affair. My parents indeed tried to push me towards a career path that I did not desire. Over the years, they tried to nurture me to like a certain career. Their reason for doing this was that the specific career of their choice was very promising. However, as Kane (81) explains, there is no certainty in any career. For years, I tried to please them and pretended to be excited about joining college and studying for that specific career. Finally, I decided to tell them how I felt about the whole issue. Initially, they did not understand why I wanted to do something else. However, later on, they agreed that I could do anything I wanted. Right now they support my career choices and even offer to help me further my skills and knowledge in my chosen career.On the same note, I have never been advised to chase after money and forget my dreams. As mentioned, my parents wanted me to take a different career path that they thought would make me happy. However, they did not realize that that career path was not part of my dream. I had not told them that I wanted to do something else, thus they believed that their career choice was my dream. As soon as I told them that I had a different dream, they were willing to support it. It might have taken them some time to accept that I was changing careers, but eventually, they did.Besides, I believe that I would still be happy if money was not an object. Curtis (58) explains that for one to enjoy life, they have to have and to use money. I do not dispute this. However, if money was not an object, I would spend my life teaching. I enjoy making people aware and teaching is all about making people aware. I would particularly enjoy teaching teenagers in high school. Children of this age go through a lot of emotions. They are not only growing up, but society also expects them to embrace growth, regardless of whether they like it or not. I would use several strategies to be able to help these children learn everything they can.On the other hand, given money is an object, I would enjoy working in a small company as opposed to a big one. There are several reasons for this preference. To start with, smaller companies give the workers room to grow. I want to learn everything I can about my career before I lunge into the competitive corporate world. A start-up company or a small company would be the best place to learn the ins and outs of my career. Regarding starting my own private company, I believe that the experience that I get in the small company will be very helpful. This experience will help me stay afloat when I decide to start my own company.I think that the market demand for industrial engineering is in the manufacturing industry. I still think that industrial engineering will be in high demand thirty years after graduation. However, I would add that those who advance their skills will be preferred to those who just have a bachelor’s degree. The availability of oil will make industrial engineering easier because oil is core in the industrial process. One branch of industrial engineering is operations and systems engineering. This branch would attract more students if oil became cheaper. Many industrial engineers will agree that it is the oil business that makes industrial engineering lucrative. Cheap oil would, therefore, reduce the value of the engineering course.In the same breadth, the current job market is bright. Auyang and Auyang (45) argue that many students are flocking into engineering courses. However, the world is also in need of all types of engineers, especially industrial engineers. It is important to mention that there is a risk of facing unemployment. Conversely, this risk depends on how well an individual is at their work and not because of having too many professionals. Industrial engineering is very sensitive to tech automation, new technology, competition from low-cost economics, the availability of natural resources, and the cost of energy. I will, therefore, ensure that I have all knowledge of the latest technology, economics, natural resources, and energy. Also, good knowledge in the mentioned areas will give me a competitive advantage when looking for a job.Nov (141) defines automation engineering as the creation and the application of technology in an attempt to check and control the manufacture and delivery of products. The presence of automation engineering does not, in any way, limit an industrial engineer. The two engineers can work together in various ways. One of the reasons why they can work together is that the industrial engineer can offer financial skills on a project. On the other hand, the automation engineer will suggest the technology that will be used in that project, and then the industrial engineer will use that technology to do the project. On the contrary, the creation of software that teaches how to do things that the professionals can do will threaten my future career. Nevertheless, it might take a while before this type of software is accepted in the industry.I am certainly prepared to improve on my skills to adapt to changing market forces. There are various branches in industrial engineering that one can specialize in. However, knowing more than one area will boost my chances in the job market. In the same breadth, additional skills that help in the market will also be beneficial. For example, the world of technology is changing constantly. Technology is a big part of industrial engineering. Therefore, additional skills like software engineering can be very helpful. Similarly, industrial engineering, despite being one of the longest standing engineering courses, is also changing. Therefore, continuous studying will give me an advantage and make it easier to adapt to the ever-changing market.In conclusion, I believe that career choices can be made with the help of family, but the final choice should be left to the student. However, the student should not choose a career based on how much money they will make. Such a life choice should be made based on passion and the dream of the individual involved. In the same breadth, students should always advance their skills and knowledge to adapt to the ever-changing market.Works CitedAuyang, Sunny Y. and Auyang, Sunny Y. Engineering–An Endless Frontier.

Their typical concerns are said to include: managing time, choosing or changing a career, developing more satisfying relationships, increasing self-awareness, building self-confidence, resolving conflict, and dealing with change. In coping with these issues, Forney (1991) reports that many students feel stressed, confused, anxious and alienated. In these instances, the career counselor will formulate both interpersonal goals, career goals, and learning goals for these individuals, focusing on methods that will reduce students ' stress and clarify their career aspirations and goals. In addition, it is noted by Forney that often one of the primary career needs of such students is to decide upon a college major.Taking a hypothetical case of a student with the characteristics and needs described above, what a career counseling might do is first test the student for career interests, aptitudes and skills. Following this, intervention efforts would be formulated. Given the specific situation, these goals would be to increase the student 's self-awareness, self-knowledge, and self-efficacy as a",1

If an individual decides to join college, they will spend money on food. On the other hand, if they choose not to g to college, they will still spend money on food. Therefore, the cost of food cannot be considered as an opportunity cost. Similarly, clothing cannot be included in the equation because both choices will entail spending money on clothing. Clothing and food costs are not sacrifices that an individual makes when they decide to either attend or not attend college (McMahon 63).The benefits of higher education include:Preparation for a career of choice.Opportunity to improve the standards of living.Possessions of skills and knowledge necessary to pursue desired careers and professions, as well as navigate life. In addition to academic knowledge, students gain social knowledge and skills that help them in creating collaborative relationships outside of school (McMahon 71).Economic empowerment in the form of income, wages, and salaries. Research has shown that an individual’s income is directly proportional to their level of education.Enhanced decision-making capabilities. Graduates gain knowledge and experience that allows them to make healthy decisions that benefit them and society.High standards of living with regard to economic and physical well being (Vedder par. 4).Personal development: enhanced critical thinking skills, better communication skills, a greater sense of discipline, the realization of passions, and a sense of accomplishment (McMahon 76).The opportunity cost to the individual and society is dissimilar because of the varied benefits the individual and society reap from higher education. For example, the benefits that an individual gets include personal development, a career of choice, an income, and acquisition of specific knowledge and skills that are important in life (Schierenbeck 93). On the other hand, the benefits of higher education to society include lower rates of crime, social cohesion, political stability, social capital, and enhanced social mobility. Societal economic benefits include increased tax revenues, labour market flexibility, and increased innovation (Toutkoushian and Paulsen 63). As a result, individuals enjoy higher earnings, low rates of unemployment, higher productivity, and greater life satisfaction.Works CitedGoastellec, Gaele, and France Picard.

This trend is seen in virtually all fields regardless of the career type. Traditionally, women who combined their career and marriage were considered to be at a disadvantage, but this view has consistently changed as many women enter the labor market. Currently, couples are supporting each other’s career development, and there is a greater extent of acceptance of women in the workforce, sharing of marital responsibilities and increasing trend of having few children to ensure time for career development. As a greater number of women enter the labor market, there are important issues that arise in terms of balancing and managing families and careers. These women are part of an emergent new lifestyle where there are extensive opportunities for women in educational and job spheres.A dual-career couple is defined as an ‘unusual’ and ‘revolutionary’ type of family resulting from social changes and dynamic trends in marriages (Gilbert, 1994). This type of family is characterized by both heads of the family pursuing their careers full time and maintaining a marriage and children simultaneously. This type of a family is perceived as a break from the traditional families as it brings equality between the genders by breaking down the gender lines (Gibler, 1993). In a dual-career family setting, the man no longer has a sole responsibility of providing for the household as these tasks are shared between the man and the wife.Despite bridging the gender gaps, this type of family has created unique challenges and issues that relate to areas such as raising children, family role conflict, work role conflicts, role expectations and socialization. Given that both spouses are expected to perform roles that they are not traditionally socialized to experience as part of their lifestyle, they face the challenge of resolving role expectations and balancing careers and family. To maintain stable relationships, these couples are required to effectively negotiate childcare, housework and support each other emotionally to continually develop and maintain their relationships.The study of issues of dual career households is important in understanding social trends, especially the reasons for the declining in marriages globally. In the United States, the rate of marriages has declined significantly since 1970s. According to the results from a study conducted by Pew Research Center, only half of the adult population is married, and 20% of adults above 25 year of age have never been married. Currently, the most preferred method of marriage in America is cohabitation, with most people preferring to marry later in life (Wang and Parker, 2014). Other than understanding the implication of social change in influencing marriages, this topic also has important implication in academic and professional fields as it provides for more research to be conducted to bridge the informational gap on the implication of changes of marriages from traditional families to dual-career families.Review of LiteratureWork-Life Balance in Dual Career HouseholdAccording to Wheatley (2012), the increase in dual career households have been precipitated by rise in the number of women participating in the labour market, and the separation of “work-rich, time poor,” and “work-poor, time rich households”. Therefore, work-life balance on dual career households is one of the issues that has been focused in various literature.The discourse of work-life balance is very important since it focuses on the employer’s flexibility or the employees’ flexible working (Costa, 2003). Work-life balance can be described as the individuals’ ability to integrate their household/family roles and career responsibilities effectively (Wheatley, 2012). Work life balance is not easy to achieve among dual career couples, and this is due to gender equality advocacy that requires equal opportunity to both female and male in job opportunities. People have different views on work and family, and this mainly due to the difference in cultural traditions, societal institutions, and family structures (Hassan, 2010). The main issue that arises in dual career couples is balancing work and family, and this has been argued to be a very complex issue (Wheatley, 2012). Work life balance is multi-dimensional, which requires a person to effectively manage several responsibilities both at the workplace and at home (Delina, & Raya, 2016).Work related balance been a multi-dimensional concept has numerous factors that influence it from a dual career household perspective. The major factors that influence the balance between work and life of dual career couples are mainly family factors, individual factors, work factors, and organizational factors. For instance, the fact that dual careers household have more income than single-earner families have the propensity of enhancing financial pressure to the latter as compared to the former (Hanson & Ooms, 1991). Nonetheless, despite the fact that dual career household have more financial stability than the single career households, there are some problems that are associated with such families due to the aspect of juggling between work and life(Delina, & Raya, 2016). The responsibilities and tasks that are carried by couples in dual career households are more, and there are many expectation to fulfil both work and family responsibilities. For instance, Kossek et al. (2012) indicates that couples in dual career households have the propensity of being endlessly inclined to workand neglect household responsibilities due to fear of losing the job. Therefore, such households have no time for their families and the family unity becomes disoriented. There is also the issue of work to family spill over that maybe a hindrance to a happy family. The relationship between a husband and a wife is also affected since the two are too busy concentrating on work related matters (Benin & Nienstedt, 1985). The spill overs have influence on both work and family, and this is because destructive work-to-home spill over and home-to-work spill over have higher extent of turnover intentions and emotional fatigue (Babakus et al., 2008).Issues in Dual Career CouplesOne of the issues that dual career couples face is the issue of time squeeze, as they have more work to do in a very limited time span. Some studies have indicated that dual career couples have the propensity of facing this type of problem at home due to their many working hours (White et al., 2003). Management of time is a big issue and such household couples have to multi task so us to cope up effectively. Multitasking is not a good attribute since some prior studies have indicated that it reduces productivity (Rubinstein et al., 2001). Consequently, multitasking as a result of ‘time squeeze’ has the propensity of enhancing frustrations in personal life, especially since there is minimal time to relax and leisure. Dual career couples have minimal time to engage in leisure, maintain friendship, and spend time with family since they are exhausted (Delina, & Raya, 2016). Excellent quality 100% Turnitin-safe Affordable prices The other major issue and challenge that may arise in the dual career households in the aspect of role conflict (Delina, & Raya, 2016). As indicated by Ashforth et al. (2000) work-family blurring is an outcome of integrated work and family roles. Consequently, other studies have indicated that the restrictions and responsibilities within the workplace have been hazy with the growing number of dual-career couples (Roehling & Moen, 2003). Therefore, this becomes a risk between the roles of work and family scopes among the dual career households couples (Delina, & Raya, 2016). Additionally, previous studies have indicated that the couples that are in such households have to balance between work and family simultaneously and this might instigate conflict, and this is because the individual has a dilemma on what to prioritize Adams et al. 1996; Frone et al., 1997). For instance, when there is a sick child at home and there are tight deadlines to meet in the work place (Delina, & Raya, 2016). The work-related stress might affect the relationship of the couples making the marriage to deteriorate.Overworking is another issue that the couples are prone to suffer, and this is very common in dual career couples (Clark & Moen, 2001). Overworking is mainly related to the fact that the couples have a lot of tasks to complete in their respective households. The numerous responsibilities at home and role conflicts make the dual career couples to work late at weekend or take work home at evenings. The issue of working late at weekend and taking work at homes have a negative effect and interferes with family responsibilities (Neault and Pickerell, 2005). Consequently, stress and strain is also a fundamental issue among dual career couples, and this has been asserted to be mainly because of work overload and family conflict. Strain and stress also arises as couples in dual career households have to balance between aspects such as work, spouse, children, and in some cases parents, and all these variables requires energy and commitment. Consequently, some studies have indicated that dual career couples with children have more stress and strain as compared to those with no children.Parent-Adolescent Relationships in Dual-Career HouseholdsAdolescents are considered to be very rebellious and they are always trying new things, therefore they need to be watched closely and guided by their parents comprehensively. However, for dual career parents it becomes very complicated since they are both away at work and they have little time to offer the required guidance to their adolescent children. Davis, Crouter, & McHale (2006) indicate that there is continued discussion on the implication of the parents that are constantly working with and their relationship with their children. The available studies on the issue of adolescents have focused on the manner that working parents influence the growth and development of their children. Adolescents have different developmental needs as compared to the young children, however, they need time and advice of their parents (Davis, Crouter, & McHale, 2006). Thus, the fact that dual career couples have difficulty in balancing between work and family makes it difficult for them to find time to appropriately guide their children due to the conflicting roles. The relationship also become complicated when the parents are working on shift since conflicting roles will be more intense.Previous studies have indicated that parent-adolescent relationship is very important for adolescent development and this include making sure that the parents are closeness and intimate (Youniss & Smollar, 1985). The parents are should have adequate knoweledge regarding their adolescent children so as to offer the utmost support, however when both parents are more employed this type of support is absent. Adolescence has been depicted as a period of stress and storm, enhanced conflict during adolescent has been argued not to originate from the norm (Davis, Crouter, & McHale, 2006). However, some studies have indicated that when the parents-adolescent relationship is highly confliction, it is mainly because of low self-esteem and more depressive aspects among the adolescent (Davis, Crouter, & McHale, 2006). The relationship of adolescent with their parents, especially if the adolescent is in a dual career household is an issue that has to be explored comprehensively. This is because studies have indicated that both parents have an important role in implicating the well-being and development (Davis, Crouter, & McHale, 2006). Therefore, the aspect of dual career households raises different dynamics in rearing adolescents, and this is because the parents have to juggle between work and taking care of the volatile and hyper-active children.Application to Practice and ConclusionThis analysis has provided important insights that form a strong basis for application in professional practice in practical settings. Worth noting is the fact that despite the promotion of equal opportunities for men and women in both education and job environments, women still face discrimination when trying to access these opportunities. The compounding inequalities such as tenure, salary, hiring and other micro inequalities have not been solved by the many years of affirmative action that are aimed at creating an enabling environment for women to take part in the labor market as men. In the traditional societies, the expected role of women is taking care of the households, and the man taking care of providing for the complete needs of the family. However, the blurring of the gender lines not only makes the work of the women more, but also difficult to manage. Balancing a family, especially one with young or adolescent children and a career is very difficult for women as is (Miller, 2015). Young children need a lot of care, and more so adolescents who need a close relationships with their parents at the critical time when they are forming their identities. As such, it can only become even more complicated and difficult for women to balance their careers and family, in an environment where they have to struggle to be treated equally and given their deserving opportunities (Gibler, 1993). Empowerment of women and formulation of effective policy to reduce discrimination of women could help improve the extent to which women are able to balance their career and family, thereby reducing the stress and burnout experienced when trying to manage in a problematic situation.The review of the literature provides important insights into practice by providing situational factors that promote a healthy family-career balance in a dual career household. Many researchers stress that a successful life is highly dependent on a good marriage. In this case, a good marriage or choosing the most appropriate or compatible partner is key to the success of a dual career family. According to interviews conducted by Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook CEO, women executives in top leadership positions highlighted that choosing a spouse is one of the most important career choices that they ever made (Sandberg, 2013). The study revealed that these women succeeded because they married husbands who were more receptive of the idea of women earning more than them and even supported them achieve all their career goals. Sheryl Sandberg also confirmed the assertions made by other women executives by saying that “I don’t know of a single woman in a leadership position whose life partner is not fully—and I mean fully—supportive of her career. No exception” (Sandberg, 2013, p. 110). Psychologists working with dual career couples should focus on enhancing the marriage first and ensuring that there is a strong union before addressing the issues arising from family situation. This will ensure that both partners are approachable and open to accepting each other’s roles in the new lifestyle, making them even more receptive to changes and being supportive of each other.This analysis of the readings from this topic poses some questions for a scholar-practitioner that are aimed at helping in the improvement of professional practice in the future. Is full employment for both heads of a family desirable, to both of them, and the country’s GDP? How should the household chores, traditionally done by women be compensated in the new lifestyle? What measures should be adopted to ensure that the most productive and educated women are retained in the workforce while ensuring that their children received high quality care? How can modern families retain the strong national identity while moving the traditional cultures towards gender equality?",1

5bb0287c,0,"#Individual Career Plan of the Client -   Coursework ExampleIntroductionThis paper provides an individual career plan for a 24-year-old client. It presents his profile and the results of his personality assessment. It gives the interpretation of the findings and suggests career options based on the client’s education, goals, and individual traits. The paper proposes a detailed action plan and concludes by presenting a personal reflection.Client ProfileThe client is a 24-year-old White American male living in Richmond, Virginia. He has a Bachelor’s degree in Spanish and Psychology and is currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Early Childhood Education at Capella University. The client’s family lives in Austin, Texas; he rarely spends time with them. Currently, he works part-time as a sales manager for a small retailing company. The client is not satisfied with his position, as his income depends on the sales and is unstable, and the work is very time-consuming. The client wants to enhance his economic advantages, as it would allow him to improve his housing situation and provide him with the opportunity to see his family more often. He expresses the desire to pursue a career in the field of education but is not confident in his skills. He wants to use his knowledge of Spanish in his work, but it is not his priority. The client shows interest in working with people including leadership positions, teaching, and working in a team.Assessment ResultsThe 16 Type Jungian Personality Test identified that the client has an extraverted preference of general attitude (E), his method of perception is sensing (S), and the preference of judging is thinking (T); the fourth dichotomy is judging (J). The client’s scores on the Big 5 Personality Theory are 1 for extroversion, 5 for openness, 3 for agreeableness, 1 for neuroticism, and 4 for conscientiousness. The client listed the following high values from the card sort: flexibility, influencing people, knowledge, moral values, and hard work. The highest categories of the interest inventory are enterprising (5), and social categories of jobs (5). The client shows no interest in realistic and investigative sections. The chosen zone job is three, which requires medium preparation. The positions of interest listed by the client are a preschool teacher and a teacher assistant.Interpretation of AssessmentsAccording to Sample (2017), Jung’s theory of psychological types is a trusted tool used for personality assessment, which means that the findings are reliable and can be used for counseling. The 16 Type Jungian Personality Test identified that the client’s preference is extraversion. This trait can help him to succeed in jobs that involve communication and interaction with people. The client prefers sensing over intuition, which means that he focuses his attention on details and prefers to live in the present day. He values objective information above personal preferences and uses logical assumptions while making decisions. The client prefers to plan his activities and to have a sense of control over a situation.The ESTJ personality type reveals that the client can be a dedicated and organized worker (Jankowski, 2016). His other strengths are honesty, the ability to create order in his environment, and excellent leadership skills. It is clear that the job of a sales manager does not correspond to the client’s personality, as it does not give him an opportunity to use the individual traits to succeed. He cannot have control over his earnings, as they highly depend on the sales, which causes frustration.The client’s scores on the Big 5 Personality show that he is an assertive and friendly person, which can also help him in working with people or as a part of a team. His level of agreeableness is in the middle of the spectrum, which means that he is not overly competitive but does not strive to please others as well. High conscientiousness reflects that the client is well organized and disciplined, which corresponds with the results of other tests.The inventories and assessment are appropriate to the client’s developmental stage. He is a university graduate interested in the Spanish language, which matches with the chosen job categories from his interest inventory. The client has selected the third job zone even though he could be qualified for the fourth one having a Bachelor’s degree with additional training. However, as stated above, he is not fully confident in his skills and lacks professional experience. It is also essential that his degree is not in the field of education.Professional Assets/Career OptionsThe client has a Bachelor’s degree in Spanish and Psychology and is pursuing a Master’s degree in Early Childhood Education. He speaks English and Spanish, which makes him a valuable candidate for diverse working environments. The client reports having competence in international interactions and a good understanding of cultural differences. These factors match the client’s career goals in the education field, as they are valuable traits of a teacher and teacher assistant.The career options that match the client’s skills and the field of interest are an early childhood education specialist and an early childhood special education teacher. He can work as a director of educational programs. It is essential to underline that all of these options require a degree in Early Childhood Education. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2018) reports that the employment of teachers is projected to grow by 7% in the next decade.An early childhood education specialist is an instructional and counseling position; the client can work both as a teacher and as an upper-level administrator at an elementary school. According to Zhang (2017), the annual salary accounts for around $31,000. As an early childhood special education teacher, the client will be able to work on lesson plans for students, which will help him to implement his organizational skills. The starting annual salary for the position is around $21,000 (“The highest paying,” n.d.). If the client decides to work as a director of educational programs, he must have a Master’s degree in Early Childhood Education and a teaching or supervisory experience. The starting annual salary is $60,000 (“The highest paying,” n.d.). This position can be the next step in the client’s career as an educational specialist or a teacher.Individual Career PlanThere are several steps the client needs to make to pursue his career goals. Currently, he has a Bachelor’s degree in Spanish, which does not fully correspond with the requirements of the educational field. However, with his Master’s degree, the client is eligible to work in all of the suggested positions. The client is advised to follow the action plan:Receive an Associate degree in Early Childhood Education. The client’s Bachelor’s degree in Spanish is not sufficient for working in the field of education. However, an additional specialization will ensure that the client can become an assistant or a preschool teacher while pursuing his Master’s degree.Personal ReflectionThis career plan and the assessment provide valuable insight into the client’s personality and the career goals he can attain. It is notable that his personality traits correspond with his desire to become a professional educator or work with people. The career plan shows that it is reasonable for the client to change his current job to have a more stable income, which he had not realized before the assessment. The professional limitations of a career counselor include the lack of knowledge in the current requirements for careers in education and the situation of the job market.ConclusionThe client has a Bachelor’s degree in Spanish and Psychology and is currently pursuing a Master’s in Early Childhood Education. He is not satisfied with his current job as a sales manager and wants to start a career in the education field. His personality traits reveal that he is a well-organized and disciplined person. The proposed career plan suggests that the client should receive an additional degree in Early Childhood Education and gain the necessary experience in teaching before starting a new job.",1

cc31f09f,0,"#Graduate Employability Prospects and Skills -    According to Williams et al. (2016), literature has many descriptions of employability because each author uses a specific perspective. Some researchers state that employability is a set of personal skills that make a person more likely to get a job (Williams et al., 2016). Others argue that the state of the economy and education in a country or city also has to be included as personal attributes do not always guarantee employment (Williams et al. 2016). To use a general definition, employability is a combination of skills, knowledge, experience, and environmental factors that help a person gain employment.The competition for good jobs grows as people get access to higher education (Kitroeff 2018). The second challenge is the lack of qualifications to fit certain positions – new jobs often have varying requirements from educational programs (Jackson 2015). For example, the sphere of technological innovation influences people’s employment. To achieve success, graduates have to possess 21st-century skills, personal attributes that make candidates employable. Students face two challenges – intense competition and a lack of specific skills for a job. The knowledge of technology and such 21st-century skills as problem-solving and IT application skills are vital to prepare students for life-long learning. Furthermore, two personal qualities, cooperation, and initiative are crucial to promoting useful business relations and access to specialized knowledge. I would develop these skills by reviewing the latest business technology trends and educating myself using the internet.Currently, the 21st-century skills system is considered to be fundamental to all career prospects. Problem-solving is one of them – it includes one’s abilities to analyze work situations, diagnose problems, reason, and make decisions (Van Laar et al., 2017). Challenges are a part of any job; they can appear when customers are dissatisfied, when employees underperform, or when machinery breaks. I would acquire the basis for task completion and conflict resolution by roleplaying possible situations and reading about common issues in my sphere.The other 21st-century skill is the application of IT (information technology). Most business areas now use computers in the workplace; therefore, employees cannot operate without understanding how to work with technology (Kivunja 2015). For this reason, a person has to be familiar with word processing, file management, spreadsheets, the internet, and other specific programs (Van Laar et al., 2017). This skill is easy to acquire in the modern world – I use the internet and word processing programs every day, but additional courses are available online.Students need to acquire the discussed 21st-century skills and maintain their level to increase employability. However, they also must have personal attributes that will make them more qualified. The first useful behavior is cooperation, and ability, and a desire to work with other people. By being collaborative, a person creates new relationships and gains more information from others. Cooperation helps to overcome the challenge of lacking skills as it leads to mentorship (Jackson 2015). Workers with a cooperative attitude invite feedback and positive thinking, maintaining a pleasant atmosphere at work and inspiring colleagues (Jackson 2015). To develop this attribute, I have to be open-minded and positive, inviting conversation and shared decision-making.The next personal attribute is initiative – a behavior needed in creative fields as well as marketing, development, and entrepreneurship. By developing an initiative approach, a person actively participates in discussions, offers new and bold ideas, takes on responsibility, and thinks creatively (Collet, Hine & Du Plessis 2015). Also, ambition may be useful in customer communication because clients may appreciate encouragement and support. This attribute is connected to self-direction that allows workers to set and achieve personal goals (Van Laar et al., 2017). To show initiative, I have to gain an in-depth knowledge of the profession, question the existing standards, and be curious and open to new ways of thinking. An ability to take personal responsibility is another requirement because it keeps all new ideas thoughtful and useful to the organization.In conclusion, the idea of employability explains to graduate students the skills and characteristics that they have to possess to increase their chance of getting the job they want. Graduate prospects have to acquire 21st-century skills to distinguish themselves from the competition and match the specific job requirements. Problem solving and application of IT are two of these skills. The first one is necessary for every field because it allows one to overcome possible issues. The second skill is also helpful in most professions because computers are used universally. Cooperation and initiative raise can raise my employability because they create connections, invite feedback, and support continuous learning.Reference ListCollet, C, Hine, D & Du Plessis, K 2015, ‘Employability skills: perspectives from a knowledge-intensive industry,’ Education+ Training, vol. 57, no. 5, pp. 532-559.Jackson, D 2015, ‘Employability skill development in work-integrated learning: barriers and best practice,’ Studies in Higher Education, vol. 40, no. 2, pp. 350-367.Kitroeff, N 2018, ‘Unemployment rate hits 3.9%, a rare low, as job market becomes more competitive’, The New York Times, Web.Kivunja, C 2015, ‘Teaching students to learn and to work well with 21st-century skills: Unpacking the career and life skills domain of the new learning paradigm’, International Journal of Higher Education, vol. 4, no. 1, pp. 1-11.Van Laar, E, Van Deursen, AJ, Van Dijk, JA & De Haan, J 2017, ‘The relation between 21st-century skills and digital skills: a systematic literature review’, Computers in Human Behavior, vol. 72, pp. 577-588.Williams, S, Dodd, LJ, Steele, C & Randall, R 2016, ‘A systematic review of current understandings of employability,’ Journal of Education and Work, vol. 29, no. 8, pp. 877-901.",1

480f4c2e,0,"#Narrative Therapy and Career Counselling  The field of psychology has an extensive selection of approaches to therapy, many of which have shown positive results. One of the most highly-recognized approaches to therapy is the narrative one, the main feature of which is the separation between the person and their problems (Afary & Fritz, 2020). Narrative therapy has been in existence for more than thirty years and today is used by counselors worldwide. Narrative therapy enables people to develop their alternative life stories, which is particularly beneficial during career counseling.Before covering the key ideas of the narrative therapy approach, it is important to mention the authors of such influential practice. David Epson and Michael White developed narrative therapy during the 1970s-1980s (Wallace & Lewis, 2020). Unlike other therapy approaches, one chose the authors of the narrative as their foundation of anthropology, feminism, and Foucauldian philosophy instead of classic psychiatry (McLeod, 2019). As a result, narrative therapy can be considered an innovative approach, which is one of the primary reasons it attracted considerable attention.The therapy relies on the basic principle of separating the individual and their problem and attempting to develop a story that would encourage them or to make a positive change. Narrative therapy views a person as a social being and therefore takes into consideration how the individual interacts with the community they live in (Tilsen, 2021). Every person has a dominant narrative in their life imposed on them by society and family, ultimately shaping their experiences and choices. The narrative approach enables people to deconstruct the dominant narrative in their life and to address it, thus solving the existing problem. Moreover, one of the main features of the narrative approach is that the client, instead of the professional, acts as an expert since they possess exclusive knowledge about their life (Tilsen, 2021). The process of narrative therapy involves the professional asking the client questions, which can encourage them to deconstruct their problem and create new realities which they prefer. Essentially, the conversational form of narrative therapy helps the client to view certain experiences from another angle and to distill a new meaning.Narrative therapy can be successfully applied in career counseling to help people determine which occupation they would like to have. Counselors can employ narrative therapy to assist clients in uncovering the problem they face career-wise and their key strengths or interests (Niles & Nassar, 2019). Based on the established strengths and interests, clients can form a new reality that will shape their lives. Counselors must assume a supportive role in the conversation with their clients and ask them questions concerning their professional experiences. Additionally, the counselor should help the client to reflect on the experiences and to extract certain meanings. For instance, a person who is bored at their job can be asked about certain tasks, which makes them actually enjoy their work (Maree, 2019). Thus, the counselor can encourage clients to analyze their experiences and discover those that bring them satisfaction and joy. Next, the counselor can offer the client to build a reality in which they have an occupation that corresponds to their needs and interests.Narrative therapy is an effective approach in the sphere of psychology that enables people to construct new realities and thus can be used successfully in career counseling. The narrative therapy approach was created by David Epson and Michael White and was influenced by anthropology and feminism. Narrative therapy is based on the principle of cooperation between two people, where the counselor helps the client to deconstruct the dominant narratives and to create or discover new ones. The narrative approach can be used in career counseling to enable the client to reflect on their professional experiences and aspirations and uncover those they truly value.",1

Is that fair?  No.  We may see their actions clearly but the reasoning behind these is what we should focus on when it comes to judging someone’s behavior or circumstances.  A common judgment made about a person is based on their career.  In our society, it would behoove us to look at the path that leads to becoming a doctor instead of a drug dealer.Application of career theories to my own life allows for analyzing past and future career decisions.  Holland’s Theory of Careers states that one’s vocation is an expression of self, personality, and way of life.  There is an indisputable and fundamental difference in the quality of life one experiences if they choose a career one truly enjoys, versus choosing a career one detests.  A true testament to the validity of Holland’s theory, my job/career choices reflect my interests, as well as the evolution of my personality (internal self).   My first job as a fine jewelry specialist and second job as a make-up artist echo my love of the fashion world.

37c56415,0,"#Career-Related Decision-Making and Gender Differences  Summary of Research FindingsThe article by Gadassi et al. (2015) focuses on career-related decision-making differences between men and women in general and the incidence of depression in the context of career advancement in particular. The researchers conducted a study based on a self-reported questionnaire with a sample of 222 participants to measure the impact of career dictions status, career preference crystallization, and career decision-making difficulties on depression in men and women (Gadassi et al., 2015). The scholars hypothesized that since men had been previously reported to suffer from depression more often, their level of depressive symptoms associated with career decision-making would be higher. In the process of data collection and analysis, the researchers focused on specific career development needs for both genders. In particular, these needs included self-conceptualization, self-identification, ability to crystalize career preference and make proper career decisions.The study’s results indicated that the need for self-concept and identity in the context of career development was equally impactful on the emotional state of both men and women. Indeed, the difficulties in career decision-making induced a higher level of depression symptoms in the representatives of both genders on an equal level (Gadassi et al., 2015). Notably, it was found that men were more likely to experience depressive symptoms associated with difficulties in career preference crystallization. However, a small sample of the study does not allow for this finding to be generalizable. These findings discourage previous assumptions about men’s focus on accomplishment and women’s focus on socialization (Gadassi et al., 2015). On the contrary, since the challenges in career decision-making caused the same depressive symptoms in men and women, it is implied that career development is an essential need of individuals of both genders.Strengths and Weaknesses of the ArticleThe article has its strengths related to methodology, quality of data, the novelty of findings, and solution-directed implications. Firstly, the choice of research methods is a strong feature of this study due to their relevance to the researched topic. Since the investigation of personal experiences was the focus of the research, the implementation of a self-reported questionnaire allowed for the collection of relevant and accurate data. Secondly, the novelty of the research is a significant advantage of Gadassi et al.’s (2015) study. Given the relevance of gender issues in research, this article provides new insights on the issues of gender differences in experiencing career-related problems. Finally, the study’s implication in the counseling setting is another strength of this article since it provides a functional and effective solution based on the provided evidence.At the same time, there are several weaknesses that one might identify in the study. Firstly, the researchers failed to sample a sufficient population of participants that would equally represent men and women. Indeed, the non-representative male sample hinders the accuracy of findings since the male volunteers enrolled in the study agreed to participate in exchange for career advice, which might imply bias (Gadassi et al., 2015). Secondly, the limited focus on career choice might be considered a weakness of the study since it does not allow for generalizing the findings across all stages of career development. Finally, another study’s weakness is the lack of a comprehensible conceptual framework to identify the relationship between the investigated variables. Nonetheless, despite these weaknesses, the study is an invaluable source of evidence on gender issues in career development, which enriches the body of scholarly literature on the topic.",1
f643ccfa,0,"#Career in Individualist and Collectivist Societies -   Thesis ExampleYouth career choices can be affected by many factors, including individual preferences, local opportunities, parental expectations, and so forth. Cultural background can largely define the relative weight of these factors in the decision-making process. Individualistic cultures value personal success above everything else, while in the collectivistic paradigm, the individual’s contribution to the family or society matters the most. This paper aims at exploring the role of individualistic and collectivistic cultures in defining career choices and expectations for their youths and showing the differences between them.To study the influence of the different types of societies on young adults’ career aspirations, it is important to establish the distinct features of individualistic and collectivistic approaches to the issue. According to Akosah-Twumasi et al. (2008), “decision-making in individualistic cultures are based on individuals’ own wishes and desires, whilst in collectivistic cultures the primary objective is to optimize the group’s benefit” (p. 2). Hence, it is reasonable to suggest that career choices in individualistic cultures will rely more on personal preferences, while in the collectivistic societies, peer pressure and parental expectations can be the shaping factors.Young adults make their career choices based on the number of intrinsic, extrinsic, and interpersonal factors. The first type represents the individual preferences, the second considers the rational aspects, such as benefits and job security, and the third is based on the expectations of the family and friends (Akosah-Twumasi et al., 2018). In line with the previous assumptions, in a collectivistic culture, interpersonal factors should prevail over the others. The research has shown that in Croatian society, which has distinct collectivistic features, students rated importance to the community and helping others as the key points in choosing the career path (Wüst & Leko Šimić, 2017). On the contrary, these factors were low in priority to German students, who, on average, valued high income the most (Wüst & Leko Šimić, 2017). In Asian collectivist societies, students rate job accessibility and prestige as extremely important in comparison to American students (Akosah-Twumasi et al., 2018). It leads to conclusion that different extrinsic factors can define career choices in both individualistic and collectivistic cultures, while interpersonal aspects have a significant influence only in the latter.Globalization of the modern world results in cultural blending, and migrants often face the challenge of adapting to the new environment. According to Akosah-Twumasi et al. (2008), “migrant students might face a daunting task in negotiating their career needs both within host countries’ school systems and within their own family setups” (p. 3). Asian American youths tend to adopt intrinsic values as the most important in their career choices, while their parents value prestige and job security the most (Ma et al., 2014). As a result, Asian students in the US often have to look for a compromise between their aspirations and their parents’ plans, or even completely sacrifice their dreams. Ma et al. (2014) add that these students feel obliged to fulfill their parents’ expectations. Overall, the examples of internal conflicts within migrant families show how different are the core values of the individualist and collectivist cultures.The upbringing of the young adults and their career choices vary significantly depending on their parents’ cultural background. Individualistic and collectivistic approaches, associated with Western and Eastern cultures, respectively, define life goals and values differently. In some cases, it can lead to a culture clash, when in migrant families, young adults adopt the culture of the host county, and their parents refuse to do it. Considering the scope of the cultural differences, the compromise approach remains the only effective tool to prevent further discord in these situations.",1

The performance aspect of this objective can be defined as the ability to engage in meaningful communication with the representative of a company or organization in the field of my interest. The conditions necessary to fulfill the objective include a real-life scenario and the ability to gather the information and prepare for the conversation beforehand. Finally, the main criterion of successful completion of an objective is to successfully locate and communicate with four representatives within a month.The second objective is to demonstrate proper preparation for an event where job opportunities can be located (e.g. a career fair). The performance component of the objective is thus to locate suitable events within a reasonable timeframe, identify the requirements for participation, and prepare all the necessary materials and fulfill other relevant criteria. The important conditions of the objective are the timeliness of the objective (the ability to meet the event’s deadline) and the ability to prepare the necessary materials using only independent inquiry. Finally, the criterion of successful completion is the ability to participate in at least one event and detecting no more than one gap in the preparation process.The third objective is to engage in and complete the internship application of the organization of interest. The performance component, in this case, will be to locate a program of interest, identify the requirements, and submit necessary materials. The conditions include the real-life setting and the alignment of the organization with the desired area of employment. The main criterion is the ability to locate and complete at least one internship program within a week.",1

However, it requires a lot of consideration and critical decision making to avoid poor choices that could affect one’s life. Some individuals find themselves on the wrong career paths because of poor decisions that could be fostered by other people’s influence. This leads to major problems as the individual attempts to cope in the wrong job.Therefore, it is advisable to assess the suitability of a given career before making the final decision to avoid regrets in life, an issue that could be extremely expensive and an extreme waste of time. Various considerations should be taken into account when choosing a career such as an individual’s interests and educational qualifications, career goals, family considerations, capabilities and talents, and professional qualifications. This decision paper will give an in-depth discussion of the decisions surrounding a career choice. The central focus will be given to me, a holder of Master of Business Administration in Information Systems, and what I should consider when making decisions about my career choice.IntroductionAn individual’s career is crucial in determining his or her life pattern in terms of success or failure. Career choice entails progress through one’s life including formal education as well as professional work. With the emergence and advancement of various economic fields, there has been an increase in types of careers to fill the chances created to achieve success through enhanced productivity. This is because people play a great role in organizations through their expertise.Although the emergence of a wide variety of careers is deemed to be an advantage, as it helps individuals to match their educational qualifications in different economic sectors, it has some disadvantages as well. For instance, it is linked with bringing some confusion in career choice as people are presented with a variety of options (Brown, 2002). This piece of work is a decision paper looking at what I should consider when choosing my career. My education includes a Master of Business Administration in Information Systems and the task now is to determine the best career for me.Issue IdentificationIssue identification is a significant step in decision making irrespective of the level of complexity that is involved. It assists in making the right choice among given options or available alternatives. It in return allows for success in the implementation of strategies and attainment of results regarding the identified issue. Through the identification of a problem, there is a possibility to get a long-term solution rather than having a recurrent problem that needs revisiting. Just like any other problem, career choice has become a difficult task for many individuals because they become torn among options without considering all alternatives and consequences.Here, I am an individual who has done well in my studies by obtaining a bachelor’s degree in Computer sciences and a master’s of Business Administration in Information Systems. Although this is a good educational background, it does not automatically guarantee me a good position in the competitive job market. Therefore, this dictates that there is still much that should be done about considering my career choice. Some of the most important factors to consider are an individual’s interest, educational qualifications, job security and stability, chances of getting a promotion, and the remuneration offered.In my efforts towards deciding on the best career that will fit me, I need to ask myself some questions. This will help in coming up with reasons for and reasons against different career paths. The questions may seem quite obvious but in the real sense, they are extremely helpful in determining the direction in which to take based on particular considerations. Some of the questions I need to ask myself in an attempt to identify the problem issue and come up with a reliable answer regarding the best career that suits me are; am I on the job path that best suits my talents, needs, and interests and could this be the best job?. Regarding these questions the answers are “No”.This is because I do not get job satisfaction and hence I am not happy with what I do. The next question will thus be; why am I not satisfied with my current job? Some of the possible answers to this question would be the lack of opportunities to advance and poor pay that does not match my professional qualifications. The above is directly associated with the fact that I am not positioned in the right rank, which implies that the remuneration is low. Being placed at a low level or rank may also limit the chances of promotion or advancement.Other relevant questions that could assist in dealing with my career are; what are my interests? What are my abilities? What are my values? What is my personality? What are my motivations? An evaluation of answers to these questions will help in choosing a better career. What is clear is that I am not in my best position and I should plan the steps necessary to achieve my goals.My main problem is that I still feel that I have not reached my best career because working as a help desk technician does not fit my goals. More so, this applies when it comes to job satisfaction, an aspect that is very essential in allowing any individual to excel in any life issue. So the actual question remains to be; “What is the best career for me?”Issue AnalysisIssue analysis entails looking at the problem issue in detail in an attempt to come up with the best achievable solution. Although the help desk technician job falls in line with information technology, I feel that it is not my best career. This is because of the specialties that I pursued while at school and also my interests and motivations. Since my entry-level job has also limited my chances of advancement and made my payment to be far below my expectations, this lowers my morale and thus the urge to shift to a better option.Various questions could be used in analyzing the issue in question to gather a deeper understanding and find appropriate strategies to solve the problem. Questions that need to be asked will revolve around the problem issue for instance who is affected by the issue, the seriousness of the problem, the solutions available and how they could be implemented, the duration for which the problem has been experienced as well as the reason behind coming up with strategies aimed at resolving the problem. The main reason for the occurrence of this problem is a poor organizational culture within the company I work where individual qualifications are not matched with the positions offered.If only the organization offered me a more advanced job position (in terms of level) rather than the entry-level, I would be in a position to exercise my potential to the fullest and at the same time get reasonable remuneration. This would greatly enhance my job satisfaction and I feel this aspect is extremely crucial to match my goals.In my research for the possible careers that are present in the field of information technology, I was amazed by how many they are for an individual in this sector. Some of the careers include; network administrator, help desk technician, webmaster, database administrator, software programmer, and PC repair technician among others (Reynolds, 1999).Develop AlternativesIn making any decision, alternative options should be identified. This ensures that there are some comparisons and the best option is selected to arrive at an appropriate solution. Based on my educational background and my desire to acquire a better career that will enhance growth and success irrespective of location, there are several alternatives from which I could choose a career. Some of the alternatives include software programmer, network administrator, database administrator as well as webmaster. These will fit me better as compared to a help desk technician (Fisher, 2004).Evaluate AlternativesApart from developing the above-named alternatives, there is a need to evaluate the most suited option. The alternatives will be evaluated based on criteria such as the educational background, job security, remuneration, and advancement potential. To have a clearer comparison of the alternatives and then choose the most appropriate one, I will present them in a tabular form.Make a RecommendationFrom the above research and evaluation of my career path, it is evident that more time and education will be required for me to attain my goals in my career mainly because everyone is usually in the search for a better career. This is however because people make poor choices right from selecting the courses to pursue while at school as well as the job to take irrespective of interest, for example, because of the money they get or just out of desperation.After a careful evaluation of the above alternatives, I opt to pursue a career as a software programmer because there are more job stability and greater chances for advancement. The pay is also good and it interests me. In everything that one undertakes, he or she should see to it that they are involved in a career in which they believe they have a positive effect on the world around them (Stair and Stair, 2005).ImplementationTo achieve success, I will sharpen my computer language skills. To do so, I will undertake a three-month language course starting next semester. The course will cost approximately $3,000, which I will finance from my savings. I will be aggressive in my job search and once I secure a position as a software programmer, I will utilize it for my good and that of the organization at large.Review PlanPlan review is crucial in evaluating the success or failure of an activity. After three years I will appraise myself to determine my career progress. This will help in making appropriate adjustments to meet my goals. In the case of the desired performance, I will maintain the steps and take caution in case of poor performance.Review of the Decision Making ProcessFrom the above discussion, it is evident that a very small percentage of people usually have the inner conviction that they ought to follow a given career or occupation path irrespective of the conditions associated with it for instance the pay, the status as well as the responsibilities assigned to them. This, therefore, follows that in the process of choosing a career, various factors are put into consideration for instance career goals, personal problems, capabilities, and talents, educational and professional qualifications among others.In general, I can say that decision making is an incredibly crucial aspect at an individual and organizational level. The decision-making process needs to be systematic and founded on various firm facts rather than mere assumptions.There is a need to have a good statement of the problem at hand to come up with effective strategies to curb the problem. Also, various alternatives should be identified after which they should be evaluated and the best one selected for implementation to attain a solution. Every step in decision making should be treated to be equally important and thus not undermined to achieve overall success. A long-term solution should also be sought to avoid recurring problems (McGraw, 1982).",1

Proper planning at the individual and even organizational level requires appropriating all available resources or capacities and identifying in what way they can best be used for maximal gains. It requires scanning the environment and identifying anchors that can be relied on for success. This paper presents my roadmap to a successful career in the banking sector. Apart from my career plan, it also presents general views on how recruitment is done. Most importantly, the paper presents a self-evaluation in relation to what happens in the job market.Career PlanWe live in a very fast-paced world. Our world of today has numerous opportunities but not much security, especially the security of tenure. In the days of my grandparents and even parents, the security of tenure was assured. People used to work hard at school, then they would get jobs in organizations and managed to grow within the given organizations until retirement. Due to technological and socio-economic changes, the job market is more unpredictable with the coming of each day. It is for this reason that creating a dynamic career plan is very crucial.As technological and social-economic changes make the security of tenure untenable, people are tending towards entrepreneurship and being multi-skilled. The recent world recession proved yet again how unstable even old secure professions like mechanical engineering could be. In the recent recession, from which economies around the world are steadily pulling out, many people were got off guard. It just happened that all of a sudden banks were making losses due to bad loans or credit.Failing financial institution necessarily translated into many other companies’ fortunes dwindling. The most stable of brands like General Motors were threatened with indefinite closure due to losses.My career plan is as in the figure below: –My career goal is to find a job in a bank and gradually grow through the ranks as I gain financial management related skills and experience. I hope to one day become a top manager in a bank, and after some years of successful operations, I plan to start my own business and become an employer. I look forward to a career in banking because my training has been in banking-related studies. Additionally, I have also had attachments in financial institutions.Short Term Career ObjectiveMy short term career objective is to gain entry into a banking institution after graduation. From what I have read in job advertisements, most employers or recruiters seeking people who have some experience. Looking for a fulltime job immediately after graduation, I have come to understand, can be very frustrating. Despite having the necessary knowledge, having some experience in the industry plays a critical role in earning one the dream job.The internship is the best way towards bolstering one’s chances in the job market. I realize that banks do not employ fresh graduates on a permanent basis. I, therefore, hope to work for some time as an intern as I gain experience for long term engagement.I understand that finding internship sites can be tricky, but I bet I am lucky enough. My father is in the banking industry, and thus securing internship will not be a very challenging ordeal. In the labor market of today, networking plays a critical role in landing a job. Networking is done with family members, relatives or friends. Social networks also play a critical role in finding jobs. After six months or one year of internship, I will have developed enough skills and accumulated enough experience to be trusted with a full-time job.My second short term career objective will be tried as much as I can to experience work in most banking sections. This is crucial because in the first two years of my career will be about developing skills and experience for more demanding responsibilities. Once I have identified the function that best fits my aptitude or capacity, I will devote my energies to being the best at my work specialization.The road to a successful career will have its own challenges. I know that the organizations I will work with will have own internal culture and politics. There will be challenges e.g. personality clashes, people who are envious, work related challenges and even economic or market-related hardships. I have a number of strengths that will enable me to handle the challenges; the most important ones are a good disposition and the skills gained in school.I presume I will be successful in the workplace because of the work ethic I have developed. Employees ought to be focused on delivering on organizational objectives as they receive remunerations in return. Rose (2008, p.58) advises that to deliver on organizational objectives, one has to have the right kind of attitude and a dose of enthusiasm. Workplaces have their own challenges. It is easy to get negative due to attitudes of superiors, other workmates or challenges posed by the work requirements. To succeed, I will have to focus on remaining positive despite challenges and other forms of oppositions or negativities.I realize that success at the workplace is largely dependent on integrity; one can only succeed if he or she is able to win the trust and confidence of colleagues and supervisors. I will endeavour towards being straightforward and truthful in my dealings. Leading a life of integrity should definitely endear me to colleagues and supervisors. Having won their trust, getting promotions or salary increments will not be a bid deal or problem.Courtesy and politeness are the attributes I will develop. Being courteous and polite is not the same as being a weakling or submissive. As a matter of fact, my personal commitment to assertive relations will remain undeterred. Assertiveness is critical because it helps in being clear in communication. Proper communication entails that one is able to listen as well as express his or her own personal feeling or opinions respectfully (Rose 2008, 105). By being courteous and polite to all (even junior employees), I will be able to learn a lot. It will help me towards being in touch with all happenings in the organization and thus aligning myself properly. Many people loose it in organization due to living in ivory towers and not interacting with most of the employees.Apart from proper personal etiquette, I plan to work hard in my future position as an employee in a bank. Hard work does not only earn the respect of others, it often brings a lot of gratification at a personal level. Working hard is not about being a busy bee but rather working smartly towards effectiveness and efficiency in my assignments. Effectiveness comes with having the right skills and know-how while efficiency comes with applying the skills in a timely and fashionable way. With the banking knowledge gained in college and experience gained from attachments, I hope to be able to fair well as an effective and efficient employee.Middle Term Career ObjectiveMy mid term career objective is to be able to scale to career heights as an employee. I personally plan to specialize in financial management; particularly portfolio management. Training is going to be very important in my career development. Once I have earned some full time job, I hope to enroll for further studies; for more specialized studies. Through studies, accumulated experience and personal development, I trust to see my self scale the heights in a banking career.New skills play a critical role in career progression. Like indicated in the introduction, we live in dynamic times that require refreshing ones knowledge as often as possible. To grow and develop oneself or to remain relevant in a financial management field one has to be alert and studious. Those who succeed in any industry are people who are able to forecast future organizational needs early enough. Forecasting helps so that an employee may be able to align his or her skills with the future needs. By doing so, an individual becomes indispensable.Apart from industry knowledge, it is generally advisable to gain knowledge in other areas or fields so as to be an all round individual. For example, after sometime, I would like to learn some new language or learns some creative art or sport. All the new things learnt help in making life exciting which directly influences my career life.Long Term Career ObjectiveMy long term career objective is to become an entrepreneur i.e. start my own business. At the apex of my career, I plan to switch from being an employee to an employer. Entrepreneurship has for more than a decade been a global buzz word. My desire to be an entrepreneur stems from my knack for creativity and innovation. I cherish creativity and innovation because without those gifts, we remain stagnated as a race. Becoming an entrepreneur and creating a system in which others can self actualize would be very gratifying for me. It will be the highest point in my self realization or actualization.I hope to create a business empire in the financial sector of the economy. I realize many people would like to save and invest. In the coming years, the culture of saving and tending towards entrepreneurship will be more entrenched. However, not all will be smart enough as to realize how best and where best to invest. The kind of knowledge, experience and skills, which enable an individual to know how best and where best to invest, is developed over a long time.The years I will spend working in a bank or banks will be critical towards developing skills and experience necessary for an entrepreneurial venture. My fancy is to be able to help people build wealth. Doing something of interest helps in building passion in an individual. Being self employed has many challenges. There are risks and hard decision to be made. Before business picking up and establishing brand resonance, the start up requires a lot of investment and energy in marketing. However, all my working life will be preparation towards the same; thus it should not be extremely challenging finally when I get to it.Recruitment and SelectionRecruitment is a process that involves identifying and choosing the right candidate to fill a given vacancy (Edenborough 2007, p. 2). Recruitment is the process by which organizations attract, select and retain workers. The aim of recruitment is to avail enough qualified individuals or people into the organization. Sourcing for manpower is critical because without manpower organizational processes are not possible.Recruitment is the most basic function of any human resource department in an organization. Through proper recruitment procedures, skilled employees are retained in the organization while new talent is identified and brought into the organization. Recruitment is prompted by current or projected labor needs in an organization (Armstrong 2006, 157). Some human resource departments do recruitment directly while others contract external organization or human resource consultants.Recruitment ProceduresEach organization has its own procedures and policies that guide recruitment. The policies and procedures ought to be in tandem with legal provisions to avoid malpractice that may lead to lawsuits against the firm or a poor reputation (Armstrong 2006, p.10). The policies and procedures also ensure that only qualified candidates are selected. Setting of recruitment policies and procedures is a critical function of the human resource department.A recruitment policy defines the code of conduct followed by recruiters when recruiting. For example, typical recruitment policy requires recruiters to advertise all available vacancies internally before external advertisement unless warranted by some rationale (Beardwell& Tim 2007, 64). Recruiters are also required to ensure all job applicants are replied to as fast as possible. Proper recruitment policy also aims at ensuring potential candidates are provided with all necessary job details and associated conditions.Courtesy is stressed and all recruiters are encouraged towards efficiency and effectiveness. Recruitment policies and procedures ensure that all individuals invited for interviews are given fair, thorough and respectful evaluations. There are often claims of discrimination in recruitment. Organizations strive towards avoiding any forms of discrimination by setting good policies and procedures. Sex, age, physical disability or religion should not by any chance disqualify individuals for jobs they can do.Recruitment MethodsRecruitment methods are largely grouped or characterized into two i.e. traditional recruitment methods and contemporary/internet based recruitment methods (Edenborough 2007, p. 2). Traditional recruitment involves an organization placing advertisements in newspapers or other Medias and allowing prospective candidates to send in their papers. A panel reviews the applications, sieves to identify the right candidates for interview, notifies the candidates for interviews and conducts the interviews. Contemporary recruitment procedures are more holistic as they go beyond traditional procedures to engage candidates in tests and other real activities that would help gauge their suitability.Companies like KPMG provide a comprehensive recruitment procedure which consists of candidates going through an assessment center. Various activities such as in tray activities, presentations, group work and one on one interview are undertaken. Assessment centers are used because it is the most holistic recruitment method. IBM on its part engages its candidates to a written test, then a technical interview, an HR interview and occasionally group discussions are added to the process. The process is designed so that it determines knowledgeableness, technical competences and general competence.Recruitment methods can be looked at in terms of external sourcing methods or internal sourcing methods. The external sourcing methods aim at attracting candidates from outside while internal methods tap into skill already existent in an organization. In external recruitment, an organization can do the selection itself or engage the services of an external recruiter or recruitment agency. Internal recruitment often involves posting information internally about availability of a vacancy. External sourcing is more demanding and expensive than internal sourcing. It involves such costs as advertisement, reviewing numerous applications.Recruitment takes into account three stages. The first stage is identifying or projecting labor needs thus being able to define vacancy requirements. According to Armstrong (2006, p. 164), this involves preparing job descriptions and specifications; deciding terms and conditions of employment. A job description sets out the basic details of the job. It defines the reporting relationships i.e. who reports to the post and whom does the person holding the position report to.The job description, further, defines the overall objective of the job and the main activities or tasks carried out (Edenborough 2007, p. 90). The job description also spells out clearly any other special requirements or features. For recruitment purposes, information may be provided on the arrangements for training and development and career opportunities.The job descriptions are advertised with specifications on the kind of person that would fit into the job. The personnel specifications define the educational level, training level and general educational qualifications required. The personnel specifications also outline the experience and personal competences required for proper handling of tasks in the given post.Once the job description has been defined, ways of attracting potential candidates are devised and engaged. Attracting candidates often happens through advertising vacancy in appropriate media. Attracting candidates requires first reviewing and evaluating alternative sources of applicants. Applicants can be sourced either from inside and out of the organization. Once the right source of applicants has been identified, the human resource department advertises the vacancy on its own or engages the services of agencies and consultants. Primarily, it is a matter of identifying, evaluating and using the most appropriate sources of applicants.Sometimes vacancies are advertised only to attract few applications. In such like a case, organizations re-evaluate the job description or the targeted source of applicants. If the job was advertised internally and it attracts little or no response, chances are the required skills are not available internally or the terms and conditions are not appealing or good enough. Therefore, lack of enthusiastic response to job advertisement should lead to thorough research to establish what is wrong (Armstrong, 2006, 79).Organizations do not always advertise job vacancies. For technical or strategic positions, sometimes organizations head hunt the right candidate. Referrals are very important in head hunting. Experience and technical competence requirements often necessitates that organizations employ agencies to head hunt the right candidates. As concerns choice of candidate attraction method, the organization or human resource department considers such factors as cost to be incurred, speed considerations and availability of required potential candidates.SelectionThe last step or stage in recruitment is selection. Selection is the final choosing of employee from the many candidates identified and tested (Edenborough 2007, p. 12). Selection often is done as per a given criterion. The universal criterion is that the candidate who has the best qualities for the job is chosen. This requires that the necessary characteristics of the right candidate be established upfront.There are many selection methods used in organizations. The most popularly used method is interviewing. Interviews are a powerful tool at the hands of recruiters. It is during an interview that the recruiting officers get a personal encounter with the candidate. It is through interview that the candidate has the opportunity to market what he or she is in terms of character, skills and competencies (Beardwell & Tim 2007. 117).Therefore, it is only in an interview session that the recruiters get to meet the given individual per se. This goes along way to inform the recruiters such that objectivity is arrived at. To the extent that interviews are properly arranged, organized and carried out, to that extent the employers get the right kind of people who can fit into the organizational goals and objectives. Therefore, issues involving who does the interviews, where and how are crucial in recruitment.There are different forms or types of interviewing. Interviewing can be done directly or indirectly, individually or in a group, in a structured or unstructured way (Edenborough 2007, p. 206). Interviewing is direct when a candidate and the interviewers meet face to face. Indirect interviewing is done via telephone. A candidate is called and informed of interview time. The interviewer asks the candidate relevant questions and records the candidate’s answers.In direct interviewing, the exercise can be individual based or group based. Individual interviews are where a candidate meets with the panel of interviewers alone. Group interviews are where candidates are put in the same place and interview questions put to them as a group.Most organizations currently use modern methods of selection. The modern selection methods require combination of interviewing with other methods such as tests, assessments, presentations and exercises (Beardwell & Tim 2007, p. 140). Depending on post, practical tests to demonstrate skill are administered. At KPMG tests are done through a candidate being given a case study. If interviewing for a financial or knowledge intensive post, a case study or exercising involving interpretation of information may be employed. Presentations often require candidates to make a presentation on given topics or scenarios. For example, a candidate going for a sales management position will be given a case study so as to demonstrate how he or she is to employ knowledge and experience in delivering on sales targets.Often, once vacancies have been advertised, recruiters receive numerous applications. Their work is to sift through the numerous applications and identify suitable candidates. The suitable candidates receive invitations for interview while the unsuitable receive only acknowledgement of receipt or regret letters. The applications are evaluated based on the set job needs or requirements. Applications can at times come in at an overwhelming rate. It is at the discretion of the recruiters to choose what to evaluate and when. It follows, therefore, that applicants have to present their applications in an attractive way. Clean or neat, well organized and planned applications are more appealing than others.Recruitment is not complete until the selected candidates have been informed and invited to sign contracts. A vacancy is only filled once a candidate passes the interviews, tests and assessments and is given an offer letter. The offer letter indicates that the candidate has succeeded in impressing the recruiters and has thus been offered the job. However, the offer letter in itself is not legally binding. The candidate has to sign a contract that stipulates terms and conditions of the offer. Once contract documents have been signed by both parties, the recruitment exercise is considered successfully completed.Self Evaluation: Psychometric Test ReportsI am confident to succeed in my career plans. My confidence results from how I have been fairing in activities at university as well as the indications on the psychometric test reports. I have developed my capacity through training and experience from previous work. Apart technical knowledge accumulated from class units, I have good working knowledge of Microsoft Word for Windows, Excel Spreadsheets and Internet, which I developed from my previous work and study experience.The type at work psychometric test report indicates that my preferred work style is coordinator. According to the report coordinator style people tend towards being organized, systematic, responsible and dutiful. Coordinators are principled people who strive for clarity and deliver on their promises. They are generally uncomfortable with uncertainty and tend towards converting whatsoever is uncertain into something more concrete and understood. Coordinators value order and discipline a lot that they have some difficult dealing with change.The report on my work style is accurate. I am the kind of person who values order and discipline. I like it when people are principled and behave with integrity. Maybe my focus on being right and truthful makes me somehow inattentive to the needs and feelings of others. However, I am generally an individual others do not find very imposing. I have been a very resourceful team member on different activities at the university.The report goes further to indicate that coordinators find satisfaction in fulfilling duty and responsibility. Work for coordinators is a duty or a responsibility. As a result of their sense of responsibility and duty, they like a disciplined work place and stick to traditional values. Building order through clear structures and systems is what drives coordinators. On the work environment, the report indicates that coordinators like a disciplined and ordered work environment. Such an environment should allow for hands-on work. They have a knack for details and would want to see tangible results from their efforts.I tend to agree with the report because I find myself as a pretty focused individual. I like to do my work on time and to specifications. I think I would like a job with measurable results at the end of it. At the end of an assignment, it brings a lot of joy if there is some result I can show for the work or effort employed.I am certain my choice for a career in banking best suits me. The report indicates that coordinators enjoy work that requires tough-minded analysis, and in which one is able to influence. The work also ought to have measurable or quantifiable results or outcomes. A banking career thrives on proper analysis of business data. Financial management as a field requires serious analysis of market trends as to know what is profitable in the long run and in the short run. Coordinators also have a knack for detail which is critical in a banking career. A simple comma in a figure and a big financial mistake is in the offing.When it comes to working style, coordinators are very disciplined and awesome time managers. They tend towards being conservative. Although the report talks of coordinators not being great initiators, however once convinced of need for change they strongly champion it. Basically, I manage my time well enough. Although I do not fancy any for of recklessness, I appreciate creativity and innovation. Change when properly appropriated makes sense to me as opposed to chaotic change. I therefore fully agree with the report with regard to my working style.In the university, I have been a member of different teams working on different presentations. In some teams, I have been a team leader while in others, I just played active roles. The psychometric report affirms my leadership tendencies as it indicates that coordinators assume leadership naturally, are outgoing and direct. In relation to others, they normally come out as leaders or people who can be relied on. They easily assume responsibility and take the needs of other’s as their duty.The work type report made me convinced that I am best suited for a banking career. The career requires focused and responsible people. It provides systems that rely on clear policies, rules and structures. It is a career that enables one to employ analysis while at the same time realizing tangible results. From previous work experiences gained from university work such as group work and presentations, I feel I am ready for my career.On verbal reasoning skills my score was 24%. This score indicates that I was only better than 24% of other individuals who had taken the test. Although the test may have had its errors, the low score is generally an indication that I have to work some more on improving my verbal skills.The report on learning styles indicates that I am an activator. As per the reports description, an activator is geared towards tangible ideas, tends towards practicality as opposed to abstract considerations, is hands- on and works at a fast pace, enjoys interaction and likes things well ordered, wrapped or sealed. The report is a good account of me although I tend to imagine that I am very creative and innovative. But as the report indicates, one possess some qualities form the other learning types.On the numerical reasoning test, I scored 27%, which is somehow weak but it is to a great extent accurate. I am not very good with complex numerical applications especially when speed and accuracy are required. I would have to improve my numerical skills for a successful career in banking.CommunicationSuccessful business is only possible with proper communication. Effective and efficient communication in the market is what gives organizations a competitive edge. Organizations need to communicate because brand resonance is only possible through proper market communication. Even internal harmony in any organization is only possible if information is distributed in an efficient and effective way.Some of the common information distribution methods that are employed in organizations include; verbal communication, formal reports, memos, ad hoc conversations, reporting within organization and peer sharing. The choice of an information distribution method depends largely on who is communicating, to who, when, why, urgency of information, required security or confidentiality level, required storage needs or reference needs, and availability or affordability of means communication.Communication StylesThere are a number of communication styles employed by individuals. The most popular ones are direct communication, indirect communication and circular communication. Direct communication is where the conveyer of a message is direct and to the point. Clarity and conciseness is often the aim of direct communication. In this style of communication meaning is conveyed explicitly as it is and there is not effort to veil any nuances. At the university, we use direct communication when answering to or doing assignments. Direct communication helps save time and is widely used in formal or official communication. However, between friends, direct communication allows for expression of one’s real or raw feelings without having to coat them in any way.Indirect communication is a style used to hush the brunt of information being delivered. For example, to avoid hurting or embarrassing someone in public, one can use indirect communication style. In indirect communication, one passes a message in a non-direct way thus the message is vague and often subjective in interpretation. Meaning in indirect communication is as implied in the message or what the communication suggests.Circular communication style is also known as the contextual communication style. In this style, a speaker gives content that aims at portraying a given point. However, he or she does not clearly state the point. It is assumed by the speaker that from the content, the recipient of the information will decipher the main point. The information is delivered in a cyclic way i.e. the information has a locus or a context around which it is organized but it is for the recipient to discern the locus or context and thus get the point. This kind of communication style is used when explaining something or in the context of relationships among buddies.There are other communication styles but they are depended on direct, indirect and circular style. The idea focused style is where of key interest is the interrelation between ideas and the meaning being portrayed. Idea focused style detaches ideas from feelings thus aiming only at objectivity and calmness. The speaker and receiver are impersonal and all ideas are to be respected. This kind of communication style is used in intellectual discourse where individuals strive for objectivity as opposed to subjectivity.Communication is a critical aspect of a job search exercise or recruitment exercise. The applicant has to communicate that he or she is the right person for the job and justify why he or she thinks of self as best suited (Edenborough 2007, p. 18). The recruiters have to be able to communicate what they are looking for succinctly. They also need to employ communication tools that will help them understand candidates as accurately as possible.In most recruitment evaluations, recruiters look into the communications skills of the applicant. It is a fact that an individual who can communicate well is most likely to win a job interview. People who can communicate are trainable. Some jobs like sales are highly depended on communication skills. One can only communicate effectively about a subject if he or she understands the stuff he or she is discussing well enough. Therefore, the candidate who communicates candidly is most likely the most qualified for the job.The two important documents for a job seeker are a cover letter and Curriculum Vitae. A cover letter is basically an official letter communicating intent or interest in the advertised position. In writing the cover letter and the Curriculum Vitae, direct communication is encouraged. This means that an individual has to be direct and to the point. It often introduces the candidate, expresses interest in the job, informs of how the applicant got to know of the position’s availability and clearly outlines why the candidate should be considered.The cover letter ought to be kept official, brief and neatly organized. Curriculum Vitae (CV) are a powerful document for a job searcher. It helps in introducing applicant before he or she appears to recruiters in person. It is what gives detailed information about the candidate and is often used to judge candidate suitability.Some job advertisements specify that they do not need Curriculum Vitae but resumes. A resume is a briefer document that covers basically the applicant’s academic background and skills. Like in the CV, it is important to only include information that would be relevant to the position applied for. While CVs are detailed, resumes are brief and to the point.One on one or face to face communication skills come handy during direct interviews. In direct interviews, the recruiters meet the client and ask him or her questions. The recruiters listen to what the applicant says but also the non verbal messages he or she communicates (Edenborough 2007, p. 21). The trick with interviews is being able to remain calm, clear, concise, correct and consistent. When answering interview questions, it is good to be clear about what the question seeks to establish. Some question aim at testing applicant’s knowledge. Others seek to identify applicant’s competencies while others seek clarification on information provided in the curriculum vitae.Most often interviewees forget that an interview is supposed to be a dialogue. By not engaging the interviewers, applicants miss an opportunity to interact that would have helped them come out more favorably. As illustrated in sample question and answers on Job Bank USA (1995, p. 1), in answering interview questions, it is advised that one connects or remains relevant to the issue at hand. However, by employing such communication styles like indirect communication one can ably wade against killer questions put across by interviewers. Circular communication style comes in handy when asked open ended questions and the interviewers are not clarifying them well enough.ConclusionI am confident as I make myself ready for a career in banking. My confidence stems from the fact that my career plan is vividly clear to me. In the career plan, I was able to set both short terms, mid term and long term career objectives. I was able to outline some of the likely challenge I might face at the work place and how I would counter the same through personal etiquette, technical training and being alert to change.This paper also covered the different recruitment procedures used in companies such as IBM and KPMG. Further the paper presents a self evaluation and a discussion on communication styles. Having evaluated what happens in recruitment, I feel well prepared to handle recruitment requirements. The self evaluation bolsters my belief that I am well suited for a career in banking. Finally, a discussion on communication styles has helped me reflect more on the kind of communication strategies I need to successfully engage the job market.sAppendicesReflective Statement: Assessment Centre ActivitiesMost organizations use assessment centers in their staff recruitment. The assessment centers offer myriad processes aimed at testing different competencies. Assessment centers often come after interviews but some organizations bring them before interviews. The purpose of the assessment centers is to observe the applicants for a longer period before a final selection. In the assessment centers, a candidate is observed by several assessors for some time as he or she interacts with others or handles given challenges/ tasks.Assessment centers are taken in high esteem as being most objective or accurate selection method (Edenborough 2007, p. 143). I am also convinced that assessment centers are a more accurate selection method because an individual is observed over a longer period of time unlike in the 20 to 30 minute interviews that would traditionally be allocated to candidates in an interview. I also believe assessment centers are more objective because an individual is given a chance to demonstrate what he or she can do as opposed to just claiming without proof or being doubted from what is said in an interview.From the assessment center activities done at the university, I realized that one can enjoy the exercise as long as he or she approaches the activities with an open mind and confidence. What is critical is to have the selection criterion in mind. It is not good to act out but as long as what is being looked for is clear and you have it in you, it is not hard to bring it out thus show the best and earn a dream career.The assessment center activities go beyond mere industry knowledge to assess behavior and competencies. The activities that range from presentations, group work, individual exercises, and interviews are a holistic way of evaluating a candidate. In a way, the different activities help especially candidates who could be tensed. Sometimes due to tension, people blow their interviews. However, when the activities are many and varied the effects of tension are mitigated and one has a superb opportunity of helping assessors understand his or her capability.In essence Assessment centers can be lots of fun because they involve interaction in social events. In the informal events, a candidate meets various people; employees, assessors and candidates mixed. With an open mind and a positive attitude, one gets the opportunity to learn a lot about many different things especially the organization into which one aspires to work. I realize that the best conduct in search informal events in assessment centers is to be free, respectful to all and of good cheer. It is also good to exercise moderation and guard from any excesses because assessors learn a lot on the candidates during the informal sessions.Being attentive in assessment centers is very critical. When one is alert, he or she is likely to pick all cues that will lead to success in the assessments. For example, there are informational sessions e.g. when managers or supervisors talk about organization in introduction. Secondly, either an assessor or managers gives a brief overview of goals or aim of assessment center activity. In those information sessions, one can pick exactly what the assessors are looking for and more information about the organization.Given it is a long exercise with many stages I think remaining focused although is critical. There are different stages and some people loose it when they loose focus along the way. It is easy to forget the bigger picture of why one is at an assessment center. The big picture is proof oneself worthy of the job. The focus thus should be on using own potential or capacities in the different stages or activities as to proof worthy of employment.Making mistakes in some of the stages is inevitable; however, no mistake is too grave to cost performance in all remaining stages. There could be a temptation of getting disorientated due to a mistake made at some stage. The ability to pull oneself together after a mistake is likely to be more impressive to assessors and even place a candidate far above the rest.Having experienced assessment center activities at the university, I realized that preparation before going to an assessment centre is critical in determining success. Preparation would include gathering as much information as possible about the organizations. Secondly, it is good to have as much information about the industry as possible; especially recent trends or happenings. It is also good to read widely about the different activities engaged in at different assessment centers.Reading about the activities helps an individual to prepare psychological as well as intellectually. Reading widely comes in handy in the discussions and presentations. Where role plays are concerned, it is great just to let go of all fears and unleash the best of oneself. Most crucially, it is important to understand the selection criteria. All the activities in the assessment center are aimed at testing a selection criteria related competence.Reference ListArmstrong, M 2006, A Handbook of Human Resource Management Practice, 8th Ed, Kogan Page, New York.Beardwell, J, & Tim, C 2007, Human Resource Management: A Contemporary Approach, 5th Ed, Financial Times, Prentice Hall, New York.Edenborough, R 2007, Assessment Methods in Recruitment, Selection & Performance: A Manager’s Guide to Psychometric Testing, Interviews, Kogan Page, Philadelphia.Job Bank USA, 1995, Communication Skills – Interview Questions, Job Bank USA.

fce66905,0,"#Mentoring and Goals Achievement -    “Mentoring can get you straight to your goal” is Milton Chang’s (2014) article highlighting the significance of mentorship in stimulating the achievement of career goals. Mentors are knowledgeable individuals, always available to provide guidance and assistance to the mentees through a mutually beneficial relationship. According to Chang (2014), mentorship’s voice of experience enhances people’s ability to plan their careers more effectively instead of adopting a trial and error approach. However, the impact of mentorship can be subverted by the coaches’ selfish interests or mentees’ inappropriate attitude. The author’s thesis is that mentees who are keen on accomplishing their objectives should adopt an enabling mental orientation and engage altruistic individuals who are driven by a desire to help without expecting anything in return.Chang (2014) advances various key argumentations and refutations on mentorship’s ability to spur the accomplishment of defined objectives. A principal argument in the article is that mentees should enlist altruistic people as their mentors. Without such a charitable and generous spirit, a genuine, long-lasting partnership cannot develop. Chang (2014) posits that mentees ought to “engage altruistic individuals who want to be helpful and want nothing in return if you want the relationship to last” (p. 124). Additionally, the exchanges between the two parties should be intellectual “so your mentor learns something from you” (Chang, 2014, p. 124). A major refutation advanced in the article is the mentees’ know-it-all attitude, which impedes constructive engagement and repulses mentors.The article’s implication is that it amplifies the centrality of altruism, intellectual discourses, and rapport in enhancing mentorship’s role in spurring the accomplishment of career goals. Consequently, mentees should endeavor to engage selfless people as their mentors as an indispensable pillar for a genuine relationship. However, a major setback of the article is the extensive reference to personal experience as the foundation for the recommendations and the absent integration of relevant or contrasting publications. An outstanding research question arising from the article is how mentors can effectively identify altruistic and charitable people as their mentors.ReferenceChang, M. (2014).

f9c175d8,0,"#The College-to-Career Transition -    SummaryThe article “The college-to-career transition in STEM” contains an 11-year longitudinal study investigating the effects of vocational interest fit. The central hypothesis is that vocational interest fit affects choices and attitudes about the major and future jobs. In order to test it, the study tracks the number of students from 2007 to 2018, gradually examining their vocational interests, matriculation major interests, chosen degrees, and jobs chosen during the first year after graduation and seven years after graduation. Results indicated that when vocational interest coincided with chosen major, it affected major retention and first job choice (Kim & Beier, 2020). In the meantime, the relationships were mediated by several secondary values, such as attainment, utility, and relative cost. In turn, vocational interest fit with the job greatly affected career attitudes, and these relationships were further influenced by perceived career fit (Kim & Beier, 2020). Additionally, in contrast to the jobs chosen during the first year after graduation, the job fit increased over time (Kim & Beier, 2020). Overall, results showcase that vocational interest measured in college significantly helps predict future career choices.ResponseThe topic of vocational interest fit in colleges and universities provides a solid ground for research. At this point, students are incredibly invested in learning, conducting research, and shaping their future (CSU Global Library; CSUG OER). Consequently, their vocational interests serve as reliable predictors of future choices and performance, which can be a valuable asset for both students and employers. For the former, the article highlights the importance of personal preference at the beginning of their career. In addition, the study results can be used to broaden the horizon and note other essential factors that might influence career choices. For the latter, the study underlines what factors are the most important to consider when choosing young specialists to fill the job positions. Moreover, it also provides factors to consider in the light of increasing retention or making changes to the existing working environment.Reference entryKim, M. H., & Beier, M. E. (2020).

cc88a748,0,"#Personal Future Career Goal  I would like to work as a human resources manager in a medium-to-large-sized organization (one with 100 to 1000 employees). The position would enable me to leverage my leadership and communication competencies as well as my abilities to plan and allocate resources, all of which are necessary for the job (Nixon, 2019). With that said, I do not want to work for a large company because of the associated stress and overall difficulty. I would prefer to be able to settle down and start a family instead of devoting all of my time to career advancement.I would like to receive a salary of $60,000 or more after I reach my destination position. As Sharma (2016) describes, human resource managers handle a broad range of responsibilities, often with a small team unless the company is large. As such, the position warrants a substantial salary to compensate for the difficulty. Moreover, I will need a significant income to support my family, and this sum would enable me to take care of them. I would like a higher salary and will try to achieve it if possible, but not at the expense of my personal life.Currently, I do not have a family, and therefore, I am open to moving. I am prepared to take a job anywhere within the United States, but I would prefer not to leave the country. However, I expect to become less mobile as my career progresses, whether because I have bought property locally or started a family. A medium-sized firm is less likely to require me to move, which is part of the motivation for my choice. Concerning the schedule, I would prefer to adhere to a traditional 9 to 5 paradigm. There is no significant reason to deviate from the approach, which is widely used across the world.",1

Child abuse counseling helps children work through mental, emotional and also physical issues that began to build up. Abuse, causes many levels of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, or somatization disorders.There are many different types of child abuse. Most people think of child abuse, they likely think of physical abuse. Hitting, punching, and or kicking are the most common reported types of physical abuse for a child. Sadly there are many other cases of abuse for example emotional abuse. Emotional abuse involves yelling, name calling, anything hurtful towards the child. Another type of child abuse is a sexual nature. For example a child may be forced to gain in sexual acts with another person or photographed.

They tend to cover up their issues and try and handle it on their own and causing that anger and pain to build up and grow each and every day, which may begin to affect relationships with friends and or boyfriend/girlfriend. I have also experienced issues within abuse so I am able to connect with the teens and children on a personal level and try my best to connect with them. I have also mentored and guided several friends with abuse helping them grow and release that burden to stay intact.Once a child abuse counselor begins to grow closer to the child/teen they begin to get the idea of the type of abuse they have suffered, which will attempt them to get the child to open up about his/her experiences. Most counselors have said that it is a very challenging job. More so because of the abuse is very traumatizing to many children, and it can make them often afraid to trust any adult. The child abuse counselor should be able to earn the trust of the abused child/teen. That usually takes courage, compassion and lastly patience. The child must feel comfortable in the presence of a child abuse counselor before making any other move.During my years of counseling there will be hardships and bumpy road. I plan on being calm and patient with the child and or teen. Some will be rude and disrespectful it will take patience to pursue this job. I am motivated by challenges and have the ability to be flexible and fit for the job. Most people who have this job are usually not doing it for the children/teens but for the money.

Through this process the counselor is able to establish a trusting relationship with the client; as well as gain insight into his demographic information, referral reasons, current situation, previous counseling experience, birth and development history, family history, medical history, and educational/vocational background (Joshua & Brandé, 2015, p. 129 -132). Based off of the intake interview the counselor has a general idea about who the client is as well as what he needs moving forward.When screening a client, a number of questions can be asked in order to gain insight as to what the client may be struggling with or who the client is as a person. For the purpose of this study the most important questions that will be asked are as follows: what past careers have you had, what disciplines have you explored before, who influences you in your choice of careers, what would you like to change about your current career, and what would you like to change about your previous education?

This Chapter will ContainBackground of the studyNot all artists pursue professions in the art industry because of their passion, and not all people in other industries choose their profession according to their passion.Choosing a career has been a serious discussion when it comes to Parents influencing a child. According to Taylor et al (2004) some children choose careers that would please their parents. A tendency to this occurs when parents want their children to take similar careers as them or they want their children to achieve more than what they could have, resulting to children choosing a career not for their betterment but for their parents satisfaction. There have been numerous times that an adolescent has trouble on choosing a career that they like and that would please their parents as well, there are also instances that adolescents tend to rebel on their parents due to parents choosing their career for them.Statement of the ProblemThis Study aims to discover the level of influence the parents of artists have on their decisions on pursuing the career as an artist. Specifically, this study aims to answer the following questions:What is the level of parents’ influence to the chosen career of the artists?How positive does the parents’ artist impact the career choices of the artist?How negative does the parents’ artist impact the career choices of the artist?Theoretical FrameworkAccording to Anne Roe’s personality development theory, a parent may give an impact in terms of Career choices, It is said that the career of an individual can be an outcome of how they were raised as a child. This can be used as a guide on whether the impact of a parent is negative or positive. It is also said that there are three parent-child interactions that may be the sole reason on how they choose as an individual. The first one is that a parent being overprotective and/or over demanding can cause children to rebel and get pressured. The second one is emotional rejection of a child resulting negative impact from a parent and the last one casual or loving behavior of a child resulting from positive impact of a parent.The Expectancy of parents in terms of their child’s achievements give a massive role to what career they want to pursue. In accordance to Eccles’ expectancy-value theory, there would be a domain a parent may place value on basing on the achievements their children make. These domains can be Academically inclined, Physically inclined or Artistically inclined. The word Expectation is not only focused on the future it also focuses on the present and the past. Present actions would have inclusion to what a parent might perceive in a Childs’ possible career path in which parents interpret in what they currently see their children achieving, resulting to the focus of parents being in one particular achievement their children have made. Past would be the beliefs, culture and tradition the parents have grown with.Conceptual FrameworkThis study’s independent variable would be the parents’ impact on the career choice of current and becoming artists. The influence of parents affecting the career choice of artist- either the artist pursue art as a profession because it is his/her passion or an artist pursue art as a profession because of their parents.Significance of the StudyThe findings in this study may provide information to the community’s appreciation not only on the art itself but it will give understanding to what an artist think. This study will also tackle the influence of their parents in their career choice. Specifically, the following shall be beneficial:ARTISTS. The findings in this study will not only be beneficial for the current artists of the Philippines, but also for the future artists that might struggle from the influence of their parents.PARENTS. This paper may also benefit the parents of artists further understanding on how they influence the way their children think as an artist and on how they can improve their way of influencing their children.FUTURE RESEARCHERS. This research may serve as a reference for future researchers who plan on improving the study, specifically researchers from the Bachelor of Arts program.Scope and LimitationsThis study will focus on different artists with different professions in the Philippines, This study will be limited to the views of an artist to how their parents affect their career choices, The researcher will be conducting an Interview to further broaden the claim that parents place a big role on the career choice an artist.

According to the findings of Sarwar, s. (2016) authoritarian parenting or permissive and neglecting parenting usually leads children to be delinquent. The parent-child relationship battles through a lot of misunderstanding especially because they are from far generations, this relationship can influence the decision making of children as they may either neglect their parents involvement or be forced to follow them .Activity wise, in the free time of children especially on the adolescence stage. (Kumar and Arockiasamy, 2012) Parents are more cautious on what their children do on their free time. (Burak, 2014) In this parents tend to focus on what their children’s capacity on a specific activity and/or if they can excel in it as they grow up. If a parent may seem to dislike or disapproves something that their children are fond of it will either have a negative or positive effect, this is where the child improves more due to anger or sadness, turning into a stage of acceptance in the part of the child as time comes and they get older. As for Motivating a child into doing what they are passionate about, parents may be an instrument on the motivation of a child. The attitude of the child can develop in this making such big influences on their future decisions.(Barrioh, 2018)According to the statistics shown by Araque, J. C., Wietstock, C., Cova, H. M., & Zepeda, S. (2017). There are positive results on the Latinno Parents knowledge and engagement to school activities and to the educational system. Parents make sure that they take up major subjects and that their children do their best in school, this makes an extortionate influence on how their children would perform on the school, the grades that they have and the extra-curricular activities that they uptake. There is a part in the study of Wiseman, 2011 that indicates “several students found that their families’ participation was a source of strength and support, some students did not have a relationship with their families that encouraged them to share the personal topics that they wrote about during the poetry workshop.” Those who received participation from their Families felt positive on their writings. Writing poems was a bridge to the students to their parents to be more involved in their likings.Career ChoiceIt is true that not all artist have took up the field of arts as their career choice but that doesn’t remove their involvement in the Art industry. There will be a lot of factors that may change a child’s perception on being a full time artist. And a big part of it is how involved their parents are and the knowledge of parents in the career that their children would like to have. in the study of Zellweger, Seiger and Halter (2011) families with business backgrounds will have a tendency to have their children be the successors of the said business. Whether the Child may be artistically inclined, this might just be ignored by the parents since the mindset is that they need to pursue the family business.In terms of inheritance of career there are still children who chose to partake their own careers rather than pursuing a career that is related to their parents. In the statistics that Goodale and Hall (1976) majority of sons in the family pursue the same career as their parents. A child may also choose a career basing on what they have achieved (Duncan, Featherman and Duncan,1972; Gordon, 1972; kerckhoff, 1974; Turner 1962) this is can be a way of someone to identify their possible careers, a childhood attainment that they excel in till present. According To the case study of Kemboi, Kindiki, and Misigo (2016) There are six personality types, Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising and Conventional. They have used this to identify the distribution of the possible career choices in each degree in the Moi University in Kenya. Identifying the personality types would be helpful on choosing a career to pursue.Being an ArtistIn all forms of being an artist, some people still cannot accept that it is a profession chosen by people, ridiculing the career and the abilities of artists.In the concept of (Jary, 2002) the reality is that majority of the artists need to find other ways of income. There is a struggle in any career, but there is this stereotype that has stuck in the minds of filipinos that being an artist will not take you anywhere nor give you any income, another is that it is considered as a hobby and not as a career that someone can partake. And this stereotype needs to stop. The audience do not see the bigger picture in being an artist, art is inclined in mostly all of the things that they see and use in this world.Being an artist is not limited for people who have taken courses in the art industry. There are lots of artist that do/have not partaken a course in the art industry in which we call self-learned artists. In the case study of Winkler and Denmead (2016) they have interviewed teaching artists. The artists were all considered artists even if there courses were not related to them, this only proves that even if you are partaking other professions, you can still be an artist.",1

Career counselling conducted by counsellors has to deliver quality service to client’s primary need without stretching its purpose beyond its intent. The versatility of skills and knowledge expected of the career counsellor in processing with client their career choices requires specialised training and the coaches who possesses personality characteristics that makes this journey more pleasant and motivating.

d860d3de,0,"#Career in Individualist and Collectivist Societies -   Thesis ExampleYouth career choices can be affected by many factors, including individual preferences, local opportunities, parental expectations, and so forth. Cultural background can largely define the relative weight of these factors in the decision-making process. Individualistic cultures value personal success above everything else, while in the collectivistic paradigm, the individual’s contribution to the family or society matters the most. This paper aims at exploring the role of individualistic and collectivistic cultures in defining career choices and expectations for their youths and showing the differences between them.To study the influence of the different types of societies on young adults’ career aspirations, it is important to establish the distinct features of individualistic and collectivistic approaches to the issue. According to Akosah-Twumasi et al. (2008), “decision-making in individualistic cultures are based on individuals’ own wishes and desires, whilst in collectivistic cultures the primary objective is to optimize the group’s benefit” (p. 2). Hence, it is reasonable to suggest that career choices in individualistic cultures will rely more on personal preferences, while in the collectivistic societies, peer pressure and parental expectations can be the shaping factors.Young adults make their career choices based on the number of intrinsic, extrinsic, and interpersonal factors. The first type represents the individual preferences, the second considers the rational aspects, such as benefits and job security, and the third is based on the expectations of the family and friends (Akosah-Twumasi et al., 2018). In line with the previous assumptions, in a collectivistic culture, interpersonal factors should prevail over the others. The research has shown that in Croatian society, which has distinct collectivistic features, students rated importance to the community and helping others as the key points in choosing the career path (Wüst & Leko Šimić, 2017). On the contrary, these factors were low in priority to German students, who, on average, valued high income the most (Wüst & Leko Šimić, 2017). In Asian collectivist societies, students rate job accessibility and prestige as extremely important in comparison to American students (Akosah-Twumasi et al., 2018). It leads to conclusion that different extrinsic factors can define career choices in both individualistic and collectivistic cultures, while interpersonal aspects have a significant influence only in the latter.Globalization of the modern world results in cultural blending, and migrants often face the challenge of adapting to the new environment. According to Akosah-Twumasi et al. (2008), “migrant students might face a daunting task in negotiating their career needs both within host countries’ school systems and within their own family setups” (p. 3). Asian American youths tend to adopt intrinsic values as the most important in their career choices, while their parents value prestige and job security the most (Ma et al., 2014). As a result, Asian students in the US often have to look for a compromise between their aspirations and their parents’ plans, or even completely sacrifice their dreams. Ma et al. (2014) add that these students feel obliged to fulfill their parents’ expectations. Overall, the examples of internal conflicts within migrant families show how different are the core values of the individualist and collectivist cultures.The upbringing of the young adults and their career choices vary significantly depending on their parents’ cultural background. Individualistic and collectivistic approaches, associated with Western and Eastern cultures, respectively, define life goals and values differently. In some cases, it can lead to a culture clash, when in migrant families, young adults adopt the culture of the host county, and their parents refuse to do it. Considering the scope of the cultural differences, the compromise approach remains the only effective tool to prevent further discord in these situations.",1

Therefore, it is necessary for a human resource manager to be careful when recruiting employees to ensure that the right candidate for a given job is selected (Gatewood, Feild, & Barrick, 2015). However, selecting one candidate from a group of qualified potential employees is a tricky affair. The HR manager may encounter competing interests because the most qualified candidate may have other traits that reduce their suitability for the job. It is necessary to consider the current needs of the firm and what the new employee could offer.The most suitable candidate for the job is Karen Comfort, who has a BSN. Karen has held a number of positions in several medical specialty practices hence has vast experience required for the job. Her time in the various practices is an asset because it contributes to her knowledge about medical terminology and technology. She is also single hence is free to travel from Monday to Friday and spend evening time with clients as the job requires. Having worked for M.D.s, D.O.s and hospital administrators implies that she is articulate.Rens Sanspit is not suitable for the job because he is changing careers and does not have the required experience to handle the competitive market of HICT solutions as a medical consultant. In addition, his health is likely to affect his performance. Even though his physician says that his condition will not affect his performance, traveling on a daily basis is likely to have health implications.Angie Gram has the right qualifications and technical know-how for the job given her competence in the working of medical devices. She is also likely to reach many potential clients due to her good interpersonal skills. However, she is not articulate because she is still working on her English-speaking skills.Medica Seles has the right experience and qualifications for the job. Her five years of experience are useful as she knows how to handle clients and can deliver what the firm requires. However, her plans of getting married are likely to interfere with her work as frequent traveling from Monday to Friday may be tricky for a newly married couple.",1

Although the career development of individuals with disabilities is not widely discussed in the literature, key pieces of legislation enacted or reauthorized in the 1990s—Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Rehabilitation Act (now Title IV of the Workforce Investment Act)—have helped increase the numbers of individuals with LD in postsecondary education and the awareness of their needs in the workplace (Hitchings and Retish 2000). This Brief reviews research on the career development needs of persons with LD and describes practices to assist them with the process of gaining and maintaining employment.Employment IssuesLearning disabilities are generally defined as significant difficulties in the acquisition and use of listening, speaking, reading, writing, reasoning, or mathematical abilities (Michaels 1997; Ohler, Levinson, and Barker 1996). There are a number of types as well as major individual differences in severity, impact, and age of onset (Cummings, Maddux, and Casey 2000; Hitchings and Retish 2000). “There is no single story to tell about outcomes of students with disabilities” (Blackorby and Wagner 1997, p. 58). Many people with LD have succeeded in the workplace, often as entrepreneurs, and recent legislation is intended to ease the process of disclosing a disability and obtaining on-the-job accommodations (Brown and Gerber 1994). Adults with LD are employed at the same rate as those without disabilities, but many are underemployed—in part-time, entry-level, minimum-wage jobs (Blackorby and Wa...... middle of paper ......h Disabilities.""

18b092a2,0,"#Career Choice Reasoning and Decision-Making -   Research Paper ExampleIntroductionTo begin with, it is necessary to mention that the issues of career choice are faced by everyone sooner or later. Originally, all the preferences and the abilities are formed in the childhood and primary school period. Then, the talents and abilities should be developed sufficiently for creating the basis for the further study in order to gain the profession. The fact is that, even after choosing some particular specification, there are numerous options for everyone, thus, there is strong necessity for making firm decision, evaluating all the merits and demerits for not feeling regret for the wrong choice.Attitudes and AssumptionsFirst, it is necessary to mention that the most essential condition for the career choice is the strong wish and intention to work and develop as a professional. Originally, it is simply impossible to make a choice if one does not know what he or she wants of this life. The fact is that, the career choice is not an insurmountable task: surely, there should be some time and energy sacrificed for reaching the set up goal, nevertheless, these efforts will be compensated in future. Whether the career matches your personality, that is, how much you work within your preferences. (Cain, Oakhill & Lemmon, 2004)It should be stated that there is only one of the most essential factor for long term career satisfaction: it is necessary to find a job that will motivate and encourage for the career and professional growth. Originally, motivation touches upon numerous topics, such as:Interests“sense of achievement”Unconscious motivation factors, illuminated by models such as Maslow, Hertzberg or Firo (Kendra, 2009)The Role of MemoryTo begin with, it should be stated that memory plays one of the most essential roles for the career choice. Originally, the memory from the childhood forms the preferences of the adult life. Thus, the basis for the professions is shaped during the childish role games: thus, if a child likes playing games with medical instruments and imagine him- herself as a doctor, there is high credibility that this little human has selected the medical career.Later, the memory is required for studying the basics of the profession: in school this kid will be studying biology, math, chemistry, physics etc. Then, he or she will enter medical college or university and will study histology, micro-biology, micro anatomy, attain the skills of using medical surgery instruments, etc, depending in the selected specialization. It will be necessary to memorize numerous terms, rules, processes etc.After graduating college, the young specialist will have to study the experience of numerous honored professionals and gain his / her own experience. Here the memory will be crucial for the career growth and the necessity to follow the progress in the medical sphere. It should be stated that medical sphere is rather specific one: it is unique for its risk for the patient’s life, and, the memory for the details, which are significant for the innovative techniques and procedure innovation.ObstaclesIt is necessary to mention that in spite of all the preferences, dreams and wishes less than a half reach their aim and choose the selected career. Obstacles may be different. The reasons of these obstacles are even more various than the obstacles itself.Financial limitationsThe geographical location where you can workFamily responsibilitiesPhysical disability or restrictionLaw or wrong qualifications selectionSurely, most of the obstacles may be overcome, nevertheless, while challenging obstacles, some people feel despair and lose any encouragement and motivation to struggle for further opportunities in reaching their aim. On the one hand only sorrow and despair may be felt, on the other hand, it is clearly understood, that such people will never become professionals, as they like to choose the easiest ways in their lives. Psychological moment of overcoming the obstacles points out the fact, that if these obstacles are challenged and overcome, this specialist will reach essential heights in his or her career by challenging even more difficult obstacles and problems during the career.Types of ReasoningThe issues of experience which are regarded in this paper, and the conclusions were made on the basis of inductive type of reasoning. The fact is that, this type of reasoning is based on using a specific case or cases and deriving a general rule. It is used for making conclusions basing on observations in order to make generalizations. It is necessary to mention that generalization in this case is the only way to make some decisions or conclusions.Another type of reasoning is the Modal logic. Originally, this is the way of arguing about necessity and possibility. Taking into account the previous discussion, it should be stated that modal logic reasoning was used for defining the key necessities for choosing the career and then reaching the set up goals and aims. (Marta, 2009)The conclusions from the experience were taken from the reviewed concepts and perceptions towards the course. These were the result of perception on the existing conditions on the matters of career relating to the course. New learning could have manifested itself in the knowledge that it was possible to change to a better course. Nevertheless, the change to a second possible course was affected by the current perception about it or about the first one. Observational learning was not much determiner for the new decision or outcome because it really did not matter that others were interested in making a transfer to a course of the choice.IdeasThe reasoning process in this case could have been enhanced by the careful consideration and analysis of the factors in question, for instance, amount and exactness of the knowledge gained on the first course either from friends or other people through listening or other processes. The process would have been improved by the consideration of separating feelings, emotions and personal experiences about the first course from the actual information generated, so that these interpersonal issues would not affect the outcomes more than the actual information. The outcome would also have been better if the future conditions were known or more certain. In this case, the fears, relating to choice of certain career over others would have been spelled.ConclusionFinally, it should be stated that the reasoning on the matters of career choice, or any other issue which is closely linked with anxiety, confusion, or ambivalence, and requires experience for making the correct decision may entail only induction, and the reasoning in the matters of necessities and requirements. All the other types of reasoning will be useless and not so helpful.",1

I am also competent in fashion and design in the clothing industry. Also, I am talented in sports and leadership. I gained experience during earlier schooling where I played games like basketball and table tennis, participated in scouting, and journalism clubs. This earned me a leadership post in the students’ leadership union in college, which led students’ grievances to be approached systematically.Competitive advantagesI started my information technology course from a technical training institution earning me a diploma in the same area, which mainly deals with the technical part of every course, like maintenance. Exposure to this course has made me making me multitask in any organization where I have worked. This saves money for the employer.Another advantage is the ability to work long hours, competently, and with minimal supervision. Also, I trained as a fashion designer without any area of specification making me fit to work in every area of production in that field.Personal situational analysis (SWOT)Strong and established marketsModern facilitiesHigh-quality employeesHigh returns and incomesOutstanding Service productionDiverse market on the location of choiceLack of enough capital to finance a huge stockLack of enough experience to run a sole businessFear of failure of the businessHigh Capacity of expansionImproved current technologyUpcoming expensive current technology equipmentCorruptionTheft and insecurityOpportunitiesThere is the availability of ultra-modern technology and facilities. It is possible to use this technology and integrate it with my other interest in the fashion industry to come up with a formidable product. This business will be located around an industrial or academic environment, where there is the availability of a wide range of customers. There is a large demand for services such as photocopying, scanning of documents among others. Another opportunity is the fast-growing trend of online services in almost every institution of education and business. For instance, applications for employment require the internet, thus the introduction of cyber cafes to serve this need is another opportunityThreatsSeveral threats are emerging which might make my progress slow. These include the emergence of competitors who are more financially stable, and who can introduce better technology that pushes competition to higher heights. This might lead to a loss of customers as well as income. Moreover, a lot of investment is required to match the ever-changing preferences of consumers and especially the youth.StrengthsOpen-mindedness is the most important of my strengths. I can think through and examine opportunities from all angles. Also, I can master new skills, topics, and bodies of knowledge, whether on one’s own or formally. I am Kind and I do favors as well as good deeds for others. I also have an attitude of endurance even in harsh and non-productive seasons. My experience in both information technology and fashion design makes my chances of excelling very high.WeaknessesOne of my shortcomings is that I have little regard for my capabilities. A second weakness is that I am easily intimidated. Moreover, I have a spirit of competitiveness that forces me to do even the wrong things. This is disastrous, especially when there is an urgent thing to be done. Fear of failure in the field of concentration. For instance, strength could be your intelligence, your kindness, and/or your educational background. A weakness could be limited experience in your chosen field, distractibility, a tendency to be blunt. However, I am working hard to overcome these challenges in the next six months to gain better positioning in the competitive arena.Personal StrategiesUsing the internet, I intend to learn how one can use computers in art and design to use it to create clothing designs for sale in two years. Another strategy is to create a strict schedule within the three years as I further my studies. Moreover, I intend to join a certificate class on weekends to learn more about selling and marketing.Assessing the effectiveness of these strategiesThe effectiveness of these strategies will be assessed after every year by looking at my performance in school. It will also be assessed after every small achievement between the learning processes, for instance, after achieving a certificate in sales and marketing certificate. However, the overall assessment will be after five years after saving enough to start my own strong business.",1

155b8144,0,"#Choosing a right career choiceChoosing a right career choicePost by MOHAMMAD HANIEF on Monday, November 6, 2023 A career is the sum of your professional journey. Many people embark on a career because it can help them achieve their goals, such as acquiring more knowledge and experience, taking on more responsibility, or earning higher salaries.But finding a career that best suits you takes time—and your career will likely shift throughout your working life. You may end up changing roles or industries as your interests, motivations, and needs change.The average person spends around one-third of their life working, so it’s no surprise that many people want to find a career that will be a good fit for them. Choosing a career first means learning as much as you can about yourself, your goals, and the larger context of work. Use the list below to help you begin that process.Choosing the right career can be difficult, but having a defined career direction will help you with getting a job. But with a little hard work, some planning, and some serious self-reflection, you can set yourself on a path towards a fruitful, fulfilling career that can provide for you and your family.A career plan is a strategy you'll continuously develop to manage your learning and progression throughout your working life. Consisting of four stages, its purpose is to help you visualise the actions you need to take to achieve your career goals, and how to put these actions into practice.Career planning is important for a number of reasons - having a career development plan in place reduce the risk of you making impulsive decisions, and it helps you to recognise when you're ready to look for new career opportunities and develop new skills.It also pays to seek out a traditional in-person third party, such as a school counselor. In addition to providing you with resources to help you select the next step in your higher education path, a counselor can also help you envision your career path. Let’s look at some of the biggest things to keep in my mind when looking past college to enter the real world.Your passion and skillsWhat do you love to do? What would you do for free and still be happy? Your career may not ultimately be a perfect match to what you come up with, but daydream for a bit and then write down the biggest reasons you get up in the morning. What inspires you? What drives you? After you write that initial list, do you see any links in common?Furthermore, take a minute and write down your top skills (writing, mathematics, computer coding, etc.). Do you see any connections that jump out between the two lists? If you do, you might be well on your way down your career path.Your personalityEqually important to knowing what you love and what you are good at is knowing what makes you. If you are a people person, it would probably not be a good idea for you to run a library. If you are more of an introvert, you may not want to get into the field of customer service or hospitality.Your goalsWhat do you want out of your career the most? Is having a high salary the biggest motivator or is a solid work-life balance your North Star? Do you want to travel the world or work remotely with ease from your kitchen table? Do you want to live in the heart of a major city in an apartment or in a more rural setting on a big plot of land? Where do you see yourself five, 10, or 20 years down the road?Before you begin searching for your possible careers, you need to start plotting out what your future could look like. Write up a list of what is most important to you. This is where creating a vision board could also come in handy to help you begin to hone in on the pillars of your potential career.Your valuesWhat do you value the most when it comes to finding a career? Just as you need to start thinking about your goals, you need to determine what values will help propel you to those goals. It may be handy to keep your list of personality traits nearby for this exercise because many of them may be connected to your values.What type of work culture or leadership structure do you think you would thrive in? Are there any “deal breakers” that arise from your personal convictions? Many of these answers may take years to reveal themselves, but some may be easier to see than others.Your job prospects and outlooksAlong with passion, you must also factor in practicality — as in what jobs are dying off and which ones are projected to surge in terms of popularity and necessity to meet the needs of our changing world.Your educational costs and trainingSimply put, no two occupations are the same when it comes to the amount of education and training needed. Some require graduate school. Some require internships. Some professions, such as becoming a doctor, require logging in a certain number of hours as a resident.As you continue to whittle down your list of possible occupations, know how much schooling and training will be necessary for you to obtain a certain profession. That will help you begin to create a rough timeline in your mind of when you can go from student to practitioner — and determine the possible costs of those educational paths as you start planning for college and managing your finances.Your resources at home and schoolIt also pays to seek out a traditional in-person third party, such as a school counselor. In addition to providing you with resources to help you select the next step in your higher education path, a counselor can also help you envision your career path.Lastly, you can always sit down with a parent or family member — especially if he or she is in a profession that is of interest to you. Even if they are not, there is a good chance that they might know someone who is — and could possibly set up an informational interview.Your learning opportunitiesOne of the best ways to get a feel for a particular occupation is to set up an informational interview with a person from that industry. Reach out to someone via email to set up 15 minutes to talk either by phone, Zoom, or, if local, in-person for a cup of coffee.Prepare a brief list of questions to ask, with the last question being “How can I help you?” Ask who else you should contact. Follow up with a thank-you note, and, before long, you will be well on your way to learning about the art of networking as you continue to progress down your career path.A recent survey on career option awareness among Indian students has revealed that a staggering 93% of the students aged 14 to 21 were aware of just seven career options though there are more than 250 different types of job options available in India.If you don’t know what to do, you’re like many other students and it’s perfectly normal. Not many people have a firm career choice in mind. It can be a difficult decision and this is where we can help.The first career you choose doesn’t have to be the one you stay in for life. It’s best to think about your initial career steps rather than being daunted by a long-term decision. The earlier you start thinking about your career choices, the more time you’ll have to plan ahead before you graduate. You should make a positive start by gaining experience or volunteering in an area that interests you. This will give you more knowledge and add valuable skills to your CV.(The author can be connected through email on m.hanief@gmail.com.Twitter/ X : @haniefmha)",1
0b193f75,0,"#The Future of Career Development. -    The Future of Career Development.The Future of Career DevelopmentTrends in the changing workplace have created employment practices that have implications for career development. Company downsizing, early retirement buyouts, and the growing use of contingent employment has led some people to fear that full-time employment will not be available to them. However, new configurations of workers and alternative work arrangements do not necessarily signify lost employment opportunities. This Myths and Realities examines thedifferences between perception and practice as they relates to employment and career development.Loyalty and job security have disappeared The new ""partnership"" relationship between employer and employee, which is reportedly replacing the old ""parent-child"" relationship, emphasizes worker employability. In the ""partnership"" relationship, employers provide employees with opportunities for career and skill development, and employees take advantage of the opportunities they are given to enhance their skills, marketability, and potential for continued employment. Philosophically, this employer-employee trade off is equally beneficial. Employers invest time and money in their employees' growth, employees learn updated skills that are reflected in improved worker productivity and increased company profits, and employers realize a good ""return on investment."" In practice, however, the cycle is not always completed.Loyalty, which seems a natural outgrowth of the give and take process, may be too elusive to rely on chance.

Nine years back, this what made me join a course in bachelor of marine engineering at MERI, the only institute in India exclusively offering such a course. Idea of venturing in to high sees, braving the storms with only handful of resources and almost completely cut off from out side world made adrenaline pumping in to my veins. All this along with opportunity to get exposure to highly sophisticated systems on board ships, which was fodder for my technical bent of mind seemed perfect for my adventure seeking personality. Through out my career progression I have made such decisions like joining LNG shipping pool of my company and seeking extra professional qualification of eligibility to sail on diesel engine driven as well as turbine driven shipsLooking back after nine years, I could not feel more assured that at that time, I made the right choice. My unusual combination of experiences sets me worlds apart from not only a normal engineer but also from a marine engineer at similar position. Working for a big shipping company, exclusively on international assignments in high tech, capital intensive and rising LNG industry is the kind of job I had envisioned at the time of finishing my graduation. I could not have come here without that choice I made back then.As suited to my challenge seeking nature I foresee my own career moving in the direction of handling higher responsibilities in the core business, initially from an advisory perspective (i.e. consulting) and ultimately from a leadership role within a manufacturing entity, preferably a start-up venture.

2bf816b7,0,"#Personal SWOT Analysis to Determine the Career Development Strategy  The use of SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis in the personal context is a good option for improving one’s abilities and eliminating problems, especially when it comes to career planning and promotion. It also allows creating a strategic plan for achieving a specific goal (Simoneaux & Stroud, 2011). My goal is to become a highly qualified professional able to apply the skills and knowledge to a variety of fields. Since the use of SWOT analysis proved to be beneficial for career growth, it will be helpful for me as well (Wislow, 2017). To successfully implement this instrument, I need to consider my strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats and create a development strategy based on these characteristics to gain a competitive advantage.StrengthsThe first characteristic in the SWOT analysis is personal strengths. It helps to assess one’s advantages in comparison with other people in the industry. From this point of view, my strengths primarily relate to the ability to learn fast and change under emerging circumstances (see Appendix). They are complemented by my flexibility and orientation on people while working. The latter contributes to the successful resolution of conflicts in the workplace, which is my principal achievement, and maintaining customer service quality. Hence, I am better than my colleagues in the matter related to communication, and other people support this view. This characteristic also allows me to make connections in a new place.WeaknessesThe second consideration is people’s weaknesses preventing them from career growth and making him or her focus on insignificant tasks. In my situation, the main weaknesses are my inability to say “no” to people asking me for help and the habit of taking on too many responsibilities at once (see Appendix). These points are interconnected since they both lead to the situation, in which I do not avoid any tasks and, therefore, struggle with their performance under time constraints.Another weakness is my poor tech skills, which should be improved. This necessity is defined by the needs of the present-day business world and the rapid development of technology. Even though I have no other negative work habits and do my best to comply with the requirements, the specified weaknesses can destroy my career (Coman & Ronen, 2009). As for restraining personality traits relating to fears or uncertainty, I have none.OpportunitiesThe third consideration is opportunities, and they relate to external circumstances that either help or prevent a person from achieving goals. In my case, an essential opportunity is the support of my family (see Appendix). It allows me to feel confident in situations in which I might fail, as I know they will not leave me without help. Another advantage is my good networking contacts, and it is vital in terms of receiving advice or other kinds of assistance when needed. I also have certain opportunities for the establishment of my own business in the future.Moreover, there are specific trends in the business world, requiring an individual approach to every customer. They present an opportunity for me as well, since I always succeed in such matters. My colleagues might also have similar skills, but my experience showed that the company’s owner tends to entrust these tasks to me. In this way, I can offer solutions to the company’s communication problems while using the trends to my advantage. I am confident about my skills and experience and can resolve such issues.ThreatsThe fourth criterion is threats to my personal development, which can outweigh the identified strengths and opportunities. They include high competition levels in the market, especially from people with skills and education similar to mine, and the increased demand for specialists with tech experience (see Appendix). These threats can be an obstacle to becoming a highly qualified professional, and their impact is seen in my everyday work. Thus, for example, I struggle with all the tasks that imply the use of technology. In this way, the position of my co-workers is more beneficial than mine. Hence, one of my weaknesses, poor tech skills, poses a threat to my career promotion. Fortunately, the nature of my job does not change, and it allows me to readjust to the needs of the business.DiscussionSuch an instrument as SWOT analysis allowed me to see a clear picture of my future strategy of professional growth. It was no wonder that my friends’ and family members’ feedback coincided with the analysis results, and their opinions increased my determination to work on the problems to achieve my goal. It implies eliminating the identified issues related to my tech skills and the propensity to take on more tasks than I can perform to reduce the threat. Moreover, the strategy will include measures on the proper use of identified strengths and opportunities.ConclusionThe conducted SWOT analysis proved to be a useful tool for defining the strategy of my personal career development. Its reliability is determined not only by my perspective but also by my friends’ and family’s feedback that confirmed the conclusion. Thus, the practical implementation of the knowledge in the form of a strategic plan will help me achieve my goal and become a valuable specialist. Even the perceived weakness in being responsible can open up a new opportunity in my intention to start a business.",1
ca1336fa,0,"#Importance of Career Satisfaction Assesment  IntroductionCareer satisfaction is a complex and subjective concept with as yet undefined boundaries and many interacting variables. Often the concepts of patient satisfaction and patient perceptions of quality are used interchangeably, while there is a difference between them. While all of the main findings regarding patient dissatisfaction came from surveys, I would like to separate qualitative and quantitative data. For example, an analysis of the overall dissatisfaction rate and detailed answers would help to understand areas for improvement.However, the survey data can be used to understand the main complaints of patients for further analysis and development of improvement strategies. The areas identified as the main causes of dissatisfaction are mainly related to the elements of information provision, namely: Inability to ask questions to the supplier. Difficulty making appointments. That, in turn, affects the disposition of clients and future communication with medical staff, which was also noted as a problem area. If the identified problems are not addressed, Metropolitan Health will lose its image, which will lead to a decrease in the use of services and the organization’s market share.Communication Best PracticesThere are ways to optimize the processes of providing medical services in medical institutions. It is proposed to take the following measures: organize the presence of an administrator on duty in the lobby; eliminate the need to contact the registry (outpatient card, an appointment for an examination) (Tian et al., 2019). Many researchers proposed introducing a work standard (speech modules, instructions); developing navigational markings (pointers); the system of storage and search of maps was standardized; introducing color-coding; the system for delivering cards to offices has been improved (Tulsky et al., 2017). Based on the analysis of the questionnaires, there is no need to implement all of the above practices since the problem area has been identified. The most effective practices will be those aimed at facilitating making an appointment for patients and setting standards for communication between staff and patients. It could be communication skills training, which will eventually increase the self-efficacy of healthcare professionals and improve inter-collegiate communication and communication with patients. A patient-centered model of healthcare delivery can improve the healthcare system.StakeholdersIn the process of improving patient satisfaction, the stakeholders are the owners of the organization, medical staff, and the patients themselves. Failure to establish mutually beneficial communication between stakeholders can lead to a significant drop in the organization’s rating, and patients will choose competitors, which will reduce the institution’s profitability.Communication StrategiesThe main goal of the project communication plan is to ensure effective communication between staff and patients. It can be achieved by educating employees and conducting additional surveys to explore the critical areas for improvement in clinical practice (Curtis et al., 2017). Thus, the developed communication strategy will help Metropolitan Health become the most reliable and leading medical services provider for patients in the Voskhod region.To evaluate the communication plan, it is necessary to ask the opinion (conduct a survey) of patients, stakeholders, and sponsors about their reactions and suggestions for improvement.ConclusionsThe Metropolitan Health Patient Satisfaction Survey identified communication issues, that is, lack of communication skills among employees. In order to improve the level of organization and not lose customers, it is necessary to develop strategies to improve the quality of services provided. These can be training, established communication norms, and system improvement. The plan should include external and internal communication strategies, that is, within the team and communication with clients.",1

b76a6959,0,"#Closing the Gap Between Military Service and Civilian Career  IntroductionA gulf between Military Service and Civilian careers prevents veterans from successfully integrating into society after military service. It is crucial to offer modern veterans efficient employment services. Therefore, this topic needs research and analysis of all stakeholders’ needs, rights, and opportunities. Professionals in career development must think carefully about how to meet the needs of the veteran population, considering the substantial unemployment rate that exists at the moment (Buzzetta et al., 2017). All parties are interested in solving this problem – veterans, their families, society, the army, and the state. The loss of the opportunity to return to civil society and be a full-fledged member harms both the person himself and the community.Nowadays, a handful of resources advise creating a successful network when moving from the army to a civilian job. We can narrow the topic by identifying key parameters that will enable veterans to integrate into society. Veterans may incorporate four categories of network members into their network systems: family members, fellow veterans, civilians, and official resource people (Alonso et al., 2021). They note that role transitions and identity transitions – where one broadens one’s identity to include both a military and a new career identity are both components of transitioning from the army to a civilian profession.Various questions on the topic of adaptation of veterans to civilian life have been studied in the literature for a long time. This topic is discussed in order to select the best, most effective, and financially beneficial way to close the gap between military service and civilian career methods. The complexity of the topic is in its multidimensionality since a number of financial, social, and psychological open-ended questions need to be researched. For example, the difficulties of psychological adaptation to civilian life are deeply investigated. Another open-ended issue is the rapid acquisition of social skills required by society contrary to the military disciplinary structure. In addition, veterans have to cope with the financial and social transition from high status and high pay to an environment in which they have to start from scratch.Annotated BibliographyArmed forces service can have a long-lasting impact on an individual’s identity through changing worldviews and self-concepts, encouraging uniformity in behavior and attitudes, and separating people from civilian life. Ainspan et al. (2018) analyze this existential crisis in the context of psychological issues and find that the change generated identity conflicts and mental suffering. The article “Psychosocial Approaches to improving the military-to-civilian transition process” examines the psychological effects and difficulties of transitioning from military to civilian service. The authors consider several psychosocial methods for the treatment of PTSD, as well as approaches to community re-engagement with the help of support groups. Mitchell et al. (2020) adduce that this group of people encounter identity difficulties due to the pressure to maintain a sense of consistency between military and civilian life.The social difficulties of integrating veterans into civilian life are explored in the articles “Perceived Needs of veterans transitioning from the Military to civilian life” and “The Transition Experiences of British military veterans.” Leaving the military is a drastic change in lifestyle, location, and occupation (Derefinko et al., 2018). According to studies, this regeneration might cause the individual to feel disoriented in both the civilian and military worlds (Binks & Cambridge, 2017). The studies collected data on areas of life and social contacts that cause the most difficulties for veterans.Research by Romaniuk et al. (2020) and Buzzetta et al. (2017) focuses on the economic and financial difficulties that veterans experience when integrating. The article “Creating Hope” explores the issues of unemployment, employment, and career development for veterans. Buzzetta et al. (2017) analyzed the difficulties and existing policies to overcome them. Romaniuk et al. (2020) discuss reintegration challenges with respect to relatives, friends, and employment simultaneously.Analysis of global initiatives the US military has already established will be helpful for the research. Alonso et al. explore an official transitioning strategy titled the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) to help with veterans’ assimilation into the civilian workforce (2021). Although TAP helps occupations in the civilian market, it frequently falls short of meeting the particular requirements of various veterans. Thus, TAP does not provide enough advice for transitioning from the military to the civilian sector, particularly regarding the cultural disparities between the two and the fundamental identity transformation that comes with it (Alonso et al., 2021). Network interactions from various social circles can significantly influence a person’s professional identity growth during this period of uncertainties and identity expansion by offering emotional support.ConclusionThe choice of a military career is fraught with difficulties and risks, including barriers to adaptation after military service. To ensure access to the resources required for a smooth transition, recruits should start assessing and expanding their network long before their military departure (if applicable). The military’s career phase planning tool advises that service members start planning for their civilian careers as soon as they join the military. Military personnel can use this framework to determine who to contact if, as many military personnel say, they cannot find the time to prepare for the transition from the military to the civilian workforce. Using these structures, soldiers will be better able to create an integrated military-civilian identity, which is essential for success in transitioning from the military to the civilian workforce. In addition, the army and adaptation programs must consider the full range of emerging problems – financial, social, and psychological, and look for approaches to resolve them.",1

09db909f,0,"#Educational and Career Goals Analysis  IntroductionThe author’s current career goal is to become a nurse via the nursing program. From there, they will decide how they want to continue the career, though the current idea is to proceed to obtain a master’s degree in nursing and seek out an advanced practice nursing certification. They chose this major and career because of their personal characteristics, such as being good at caring for people and enjoying doing so. With that said, the author is also aware of the discussion currently going on regarding the impending nurse shortage, which has also motivated them to choose nursing. For the purposes of this assignment, they visited the website of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and gathered information regarding the career path. The results presented below suggest that it is a highly attractive option that they would also recommend to high schoolers looking for a future choice.Data AnalysisOverall, the position of registered nurse appears to have performed well throughout the past decade. Per Lockard and Wolf, it was projected to add 711,900 new jobs between 2010 and 2020, going from 2.7 million to 3.4 million, mostly driven by the aging U.S. population and its increased demand for medical services (95). As of 2019, the real figure, as shown by “Registered Nurses,” was at 3.1 million, indicating the figure was not achieved, and the projections were somewhat excessive. The growth rate is substantial, and the BLS projects growth of another 221,900 jobs before 2029, the fifth-largest increase in terms of raw numbers among all occupations listed (“Most New Jobs”). With that said, as Fig. 1 indicates, the rate of growth is lower than that for all healthcare diagnosing or treating practitioners. The reason may be that, in the past, growth for the profession could have been too fast at the expense of the other jobs.In terms of potential earnings, the position of the registered nurse appears to be attractive. Lockard and Wolf list the median wage for the profession at $64,690 as of 2010, which was near twice the median across all occupations at $33,840 (101). Per “Registered Nurses,” the median wage as of 2019 was $73,300, and the overall indicator was $39,810. These figures represent substantial growth overall, though it should be noted that the 13.3% median wage growth for registered nurses is lower than the 17.6% increase throughout all industries. The competition for jobs mentioned in “Registered Nurses” may be a reason for this difference, as the high number of applicants lets medical facilities set lower wages. However, this is just an assumption not necessarily backed by data, and the other factors influencing this competition will be discussed later on.Once a person has accumulated some experience, they can proceed to obtain a Master’s degree and then apply for certification as an advanced practice nurse. This position is currently relatively new but seeing rapid adoption across the country as the demand for skilled medical personnel increases and can no longer be met by physicians and similar professions. As a result, “Fastest Growing Occupations” projects a 52% increase in the number of nurse practitioner positions, which are the most common type of advanced practice nurse. As shown in Fig. 2, the growth across all types is 45%, which over ten times higher than that for all occupations. This increase represents 117,700 additional high-skilled jobs, which is appropriate for a position that required both extensive education and experience. As such, the author’s beliefs about the high demand for the profession appear to be supported by the available evidence.In terms of earnings, the more senior position is correspondingly more attractive, with all types of advanced practice nurses earning six-figure wages. “Nurse Anesthetists, Nurse Midwives, and Nurse Practitioners” claims that the median salaries for nurse anesthetists, midwives, and practitioners are $174,790, $109,820, and $105,030, respectively. These figures are 138%, 50%, and 43% higher than those for registered nurses and 339%, 176%, and 164% above the overall median. It should be noted that the relatively high nurse anesthetist wages are counteracted by the position’s low availability, with 44,900 positions existing currently and 51,000 expected to exist by 2029. As such, while the position is highly desirable, it is also going to be challenging to obtain. The author will also need to determine whether they want to work as an anesthetist and assist in various situations where the patients require anesthesia over other potential nursing occupations.In the short term, it should be noted that there are multiple ways to become a registered nurse, not all of which lead one to stand in the same position in the field. To become eligible for the license, one can obtain a bachelor’s or associate degree in nursing or complete an approved nursing program. With that said, “Registered Nurses” suggests that those with a bachelor’s degree will have a better position in the workplace, especially if they have knowledge or work experience in a particular field of care. Their competencies are expected to be higher than the others, and it will be easier for them to specialize and advance due to their qualifications and knowledge. It is still possible for others to advance, but positions that do not require a master’s degree or advanced nursing certification may be easier to achieve.When counseling a high school student looking for a major to choose, the author would explain to them that they chose nursing because they enjoyed caring for people and considered themselves capable in this regard. With that said, they would also warn the person about the potential hazards of nursing, such as the high stress imposed by the work hours and the specifics of the job. If the student were capable of withstanding the pressure, the author would recommend that they strongly consider nursing. The job prospects are excellent, with massive projected demand growth and rapidly increasing availability of high-paying positions for experienced workers.ConclusionThe author chose nursing both because of their affinity with the profession and because they heard that it had excellent future prospects. This research into the data provided by the BLS confirmed this belief, as nursing appears to overall be among the most promising fields in the United States. The number of registered nurses has been grown steadily at a faster rate than that of the total jobs over the last decade, and this tendency is expected to continue in the future. Meanwhile, the more advanced position of the advanced practice nurse is experiencing rapid growth, mostly driven by the rising demand for nurse practitioners. The author is satisfied with their choice and would recommend it to others, assuming they were able to handle the job.Works Cited“Fastest Growing Occupations.” U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020, Web.“Most New Jobs.” U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020, Web.“Nurse Anesthetists, Nurse Midwives, and Nurse Practitioners.” U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2021, Web.“Registered Nurses.” U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2021, Web.Lockard, C.

de9724d6,0,"#The Choice Milestone in Selecting a Career Path  In today’s workplace, vocational decision-making, or the process of selecting a career path, has emerged as a common and challenging matter. Relevant concerns include deciding on a profession and the necessary school preparation, choosing a job and then deciding whether to retain or quit it, pursuing official and additional informal training, and other decisions (Kulcsár et al., 2020). I agree that choosing a job is one of the most significant decisions one can make in their lifetime. According to Corey et al. (2018), it is crucial to identify the three personality types that best define you before making career-related choices. I have thus studied the seven stages suggested in the textbook and devised a strategy for how I would put them into practice while making professional decisions, taking my personality types into account.Focusing on oneself is the initial stage in a continuous process of acquiring and evaluating information. At that stage, I am expected to continue to define my hobbies, skills, aptitudes, values, beliefs, needs, and inclinations (Corey et al., 2018). The social and artistic personality types best describe me after thorough consideration. I would thus take into account my preferences in relation to the offered professions that reflect both social and creative routes. My objective for this step is to keep questioning myself in order to narrow the offered occupations according to my interests and seek supervision. The production of alternative possibilities is implied in the second stage. My objective would be to compile a list of alternative careers that I find appealing.The following step is dedicated to gathering and evaluating data on the developed alternatives. In the process of extending my list of potential careers, I would acknowledge the realities of each field and objectively assess each choice in light of my skills and ideals. According to Corey et al. (2018), one should speak with as many individuals as feasible who are engaged in the careers they are thinking about since they may offer insightful advice and useful recommendations. Therefore, in addition to performing extensive research on the subjects, one of my goals would be to communicate with those who work in the relevant professions.After the research has been conducted, I’ll combine my knowledge of myself with vocational facts, other people’s views, and their opinions to prioritize the entries on the list. In addition to assessing my own research as I approach the step of making a decision, I would seek assistance from a career counselor. According to the decision-theory approach, a career counselor’s main responsibility is to help students choose a job that fits their personality, interests, and personal objectives so they may make a well-informed career choice (Chuang et al., 2020). Evidently, the next stage is carrying out the chosen course of action. According to Corey et al. (2018), the action plan calls for learning how to sell your abilities to companies. I aim to rehearse and conduct my curriculum vitae while looking for jobs on various employment platforms to secure an interview. This professional decision-making journey concludes with a reflection and feedback phase. I believe it would ease the process of deciding whether my options are viable after going through the actual application and interview processes for employment.In general, I can say that choosing a career is a critical personal decision, especially for those like myself who pursue higher education and feel pressure to become autonomous. The process of making decisions must be methodical and based on several solid facts rather than unsupported assumptions. Several options should be found and analyzed, emphasizing the best ones chosen for execution. For the sake of achieving overall success, each phase in the decision-making process should be viewed as equally vital and should not be compromised.",1

After completing O*NET’s career interest assessment, I received the interest code I anticipated. I scored the highest in social interest, which implies I enjoy working with people, communicating with people, and teaching people (National Center for O*NET Development, 2010). I also scored considerably high in artistic interest, which signifies I enjoy self-expression, working without rules, and working with some form of design and patterns (National Center for O*NET Development, 2010).

The characteristics of counseling psychology cater to my social, artistic, enterprising, and investigative interest. I am also pursuing a master’s degree in professional counseling, which will give me the expertise to obtain a required Ph.D. for counseling psychology. This will permit me to establish my own private practice and specialize in a variety of areas, such as: profiling criminals, substance abuse, fitness and health, counseling women, and Christian…show more content…Also, almost 33.3 % of psychologists are self-employed (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2014). Whether, or whether not, counseling psychologist work alone, or with others, is determined upon their environment. However, since psychologists typically work with others to provide the best treatment for clients, they are in community with others at some point in their workday, or week. The environment counseling psychologists work in will dictate an age, socioeconomic level, presented issue range. For example, if a counseling psychologists worked in a hospital, he or she may have clients from all ages, all socioeconomic backgrounds, with all types of issues, as oppose to, a counselor who is employed at children’s clinic. Counseling psychologist have a lot of freedom to choose his or her own hours. Some counselors may work weekends and evenings to accommodate clients, similar to those who work in a hospital setting (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2014). Most counseling psychologists, who work in clinics, have a full-time, regular, business day schedule (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2014). Counseling psychologist are likely to face disgruntle and emotional patients, which can be stressful. Also, they are required to meet strict deadlines, which can be",1
cf5279da,0,"#Counseling Psychology: Career Choice -   The mentality and personality of a human being are determined by their behavior. In expressing their feelings and thoughts, the relationship is built for both parties. This is well-evaluated as a counseling process. Each would have their career choice, accountability and responsibility for choosing that particular area. The most important step in career selection is the passion for winning what one does or ought to engage in as a long-term life strategy. This paper will critically evaluate counseling psychology as a career choice, and the role information contributes to the career choice. It will discuss factors learned from the course and how they are applicable to the chosen job specification.Moreover, it will cover the recent news that helped in polishing of the career choice, and finally, the study will also outline vital issues learnt from the career choice and how it will help after the graduation in rebuilding a job opportunity that would be comfortable.Counseling is a best career choice that would help contact many people in different dimensions. As it stands, it’s a platform that conveys information that helps other people build their self-awareness and esteem. Counseling has provided a platform to help people deal and express their feelings in the right way, where no one will judge or doubt them. The information is enhanced through the counseling skills that include, active listening, which entails listening to emotional feelings and thoughts, and understanding behaviors and the actions going on in the surrounding that would cause any destructions.(Grapers 65).The role of information in counseling has also enhanced the open-minded mentality, and people can communicate freely knowing that the counselor will observe confidentiality. Information has played a part in educating the clients during the counseling processes and enabled them have an insight from different areas they are having issues dealing with.The course influences the skills of listening and feedback giving which is relevant to counseling career and provides a priority for the clients to air out their views where counselors would positively review and rectify their mistakes should there be any outlined. Feedback giving is also important in the career as it determines the attitudes and feelings one has towards specific issues. During counselors’ supervision, feedback is applied in identifying the weak areas that need to be polished. In the counseling career, feedback is evaluated and given in a sandwiched form whereby positive remarks are first encouraged, what an individual did not do right and the way forward. The manner should be polite, and the message conveyed in a proper way that will enhance the communication between both the parties and will maintain a long term relationship (Harper 12).The article provides an outline description of how counseling is applicable in the instance of WiFi tracking. Fear instilled in the woman’s mind when using the internet can be controlled through counseling sessions that would help deal with the developing phobia. Internet is also an excellent platform that helps in creating awareness on the importance of attending counseling sessions, and not just for the insane individuals.The world is cultivated in a way people have a perception that when an individual is scheduled for a therapy, they are losing their mind. Such mentality should be stopped, and it is possible through the interventions and sensitization via internet that appears to be an effective channel in the current world. When the phobia develops in a person’s life, they are not able to step up to new challenges that may develop, and as such preventing opportunities of advancing in life. The internet helped in determining the fears and weaknesses of people which is classified under the personality issues (Crossland 30). Such predicaments are concurred when the person acknowledges they have an issue and need to be resolved. The American Psychological Association further explains that the beginning of self-discovery is the acknowledgment of a problem. It describes self-awareness as journey that requires analytical approach and meditation.Counseling psychology would help in the career building after graduation through frequently practicing of the counseling skills so that all the ethical conducts are observed to avoid any malpractice. The primary and important ethical behavior is confidentiality that provides a room for private information talk, and there is guarantee for privacy on the same, between the client and the counselor. Psychology helps in understating more about human beings and their behaviors. This platform would, therefore, be applicable in creating a mutual understanding especially between the workmates (Crocket 17).During career building, counseling contributes a portion in personality discovery and ascertains the power of creating and maintaining healthy relationships in the work environment. An inclusive self-discovery and tolerance from each partner would enable a healthy firm to progress due to the management that would be easier as there are no misunderstandings. A career opportunity would be easier created once there is a personal understanding and an inbuilt-confidence geared by self-awareness process.ConclusionCreating career choices are determined by an individuals’ understanding of who they are and the goals they have set in their lives for both long and short term priorities. Counseling is a motivational career and acts on a personal level-ground to promote a self-disciplined person as soon as an individual settles at having it as a source of income. Unlike other job opportunities and career choices, counseling is not a boring career.Works CitedCrocket, Alastair. “Professional regulation-The challenges.” Journal of Business 15.1 (2014): 12-17.

Since professional development is concerned with preparing for the future, this has a long-term goal. Programs like these help employees become better at what they’re doing now, move up the corporate ladder, better understand their weaknesses and strengths, and improve their skills for promotion when the time comes (Shaito, 2019). However, the success of the program depends on the players’ abilities to overcome potential setbacks.The Rationale for this ProgramAlthough all workers need comprehensive career development programs, African American women employees are more susceptible to undesirable consequences (Xie, & Pang, 2019). Thus, it is wise for the entrusted key players to engage in interventions that would boost the employees’ self-awareness levels. Planned training will guarantee that the workers understand the distinct features of the job market, and also ensure that they acknowledge the organizational vision. Besides, it would be wise to offer incentives for reliable workers regardless of their distinct cultural backgrounds (Di Fabio, 2017). Thus, a multicultural workforce is crucial for sustainable organizational goals.Program Standards And Learning ObjectivesThe endeavor will uphold all three domains of the NCDG framework: educational achievement and lifelong studying, career management, and personal-social development. Besides highlighting the specific career objectives, workers need to develop the much-needed interpersonal skills while encouraging every member to participate in the organizational decision-making roles. Finally, promoting a much-needed multicultural team is crucial for a successful endeavor (Ishak, & Kamil, 2016).ConclusionTo ensure that the team realizes success in its endeavors, both the ASCA and the NCDG standards are crucial. The team members need to develop the much-needed interpersonal skills to ensure that they work together and remain self-motivated while executing their duties. Every member needs to be sure that they achieve their professional and personal aims (Di Fabio, 2017).",1
20a63681,0,"#Integrating Individual Differences in Career Assessment   EssayWriterArmstrong et al. (2010) suggests that counselors should not take into consideration one aspect of an individual while providing career and education related advice (Armstrong et al., 2010). Counselor should counsel in an integrated manner and should include various areas including traits, capabilities, past experiences, interests and other elements into consideration while developing a career plan for their customers. This is because different aspects of an individual impact their career choices differently. For example a person who may perceive that a particular job is quite easy for them to perform may never want to take up that job or career option. Furthermore, an individual’s cultural as well as socio economic background impacts their interest and this in turn impacts their decision making while selecting a career. For example people belonging to disadvantaged backgrounds would prefer to make career choices through which they can earn well and develop better living standards for themselves and their families. In such a scenario, the individual may forgo their own personal interests and may give precedence to the interest of their family members. For example a study was conducted by Gibbs et al. (2013) in which they identified that PhDs belonging to the area of biomedical were more inclined to pursue their career as a faculty member in the same area as a response to their personal values and these values were developed as a result of their identity within the society (Gibbs et al., 2013). Taking into consideration the results of the study conducted by Armstrong, a counselor providing services to a PhD belonging to the area of biomedical should not only consider the education as well as the traits of the individual while providing advice, they should even consider the socio economic background while helping a customer chose a career path.

When facing these important decisions, it is very easy to become confused. I once was very uncertain about any career goals I may have had, but now, I am more sure of the direction my life is going.When I was young, I never really knew what I wanted to become when I got older, but I always had very high aspirations for myself. I always thought that I would become either a doctor or a lawyer. Both professions seemed highly respected, and the high income from each was a very important factor. As I grew older, I started to drift away from dreams of becoming a lawyer, and focused toward the medical field. The more I considered this choice of a profession, I began to realize that it was what I wanted to do with my life. However, like most people, my dreams changed over the course of time. My experiences and mistakes changed my perception on life in general, as well as my dreams and goals. I went through periods of time where I wanted to become a pilot, an architect, and finally, a computer technician.

fe043d98,0,"#Professional Competencies in Education and Career -    Primarily, professional competence is one of the basic principles of the Code of Ethics for any person carrying the ‘professional’ tag. From accountants to physicians to teachers, professional competence is not only an indispensable obligation but also a fundamental prerequisite. Many firms that emphasize engagements rather than professional competence have had a myriad of problems that forces them to take legal liabilities. For instance, one career that requires utmost professional competence is accountancy. In the past, listed companies across the globe have experienced fraud due to a lack of professional competence.Consequently, this has triggered indignant denunciation from investors; their business performance has also dropped. This and many more reasons have forced colleges and universities to introduce courses on professional competence to educate students on the importance of observing professional competence in their careers. This essay will define professional competence and assess its connection to educational goals. It will also assess its influence within the workplace and the modalities of maintaining it. The paper will also discuss self-awareness and emotional influence or perceptions on legal issues and professional ethics in professional competence.To start with, professional competence is the aspect of being able to carry out duties and responsibilities within a career or occupation. In other words, professional competence is the consistent and astute use of communication, acquaintance, and values for professional practice. Additionally, professional competence involves the application of technical skills in the right way, astute clinical reasoning, and the manifestation of professional practices. Undoubtedly, professional competence is paramount to the daily running of personal businesses as well as career practices. I think professional competence plays a significant role in my life. As a student, I understand that I should work hard and score good grades through fair means. I understand that cheating in exams amounts to incompetence, and it is against rules and regulations. On the other hand, in my career as a professional, I also understand that I ought to give unsurpassed services to my clients.To set a path towards a successful career, professional competence is the benchmark for developing goals and objectives. In other words, to arrive to come up with better choices, it is better to consider decent and principled standards of professional expertise. This will ensure that clients get reliable services up to the point of absolute satisfaction. Moreover, this will enhance somebody’s urge to work towards being the best in the area of expertise and even master it. To assess professional competence, I look at the successes of my duties. For instance, if my clients compliment my work, and the company keeps drawing more and more clients, then I will know I am on the right track. Precisely, training is important in maintaining professional competence. I always attend workshop training to continue merging my knowledge and skills of practice. I also enjoy working on complex and infrequent projects that require robust knowledge and skills. Some companies have established competence assurance systems to help employees maintain their professional competencies. Here, employees learn very many things, such as risk assessment, control measures, simulation, and other safer critical tasks (Corey, Corey & Callanan, 2011).It is also important to note that self-awareness of personal life experiences promotes professional competence. Self-awareness influences emotions and perception in the manner I view my daily practices. For instance, as a competent professional, I use self-awareness to distinguish situations that require legal attention from those that demand professional ethics. Competence in the workplace does not solely require individuals to perform activities to arrive at the goals, but it involves self-awareness. For instance, I know that in dealing with intricate, collective, and technical issues in a highly vibrant environment, some disagreements can arise, and to solve them, I need to apply legal issues. Nonetheless, through self-awareness, I can negotiate effectively and structure out ethical and legal issues.Emotional influence on perceptions of legal issues and professional ethics is also an imperative component I use to assess my professional competence. As a professional, I always want to do my best to fulfill my desired performance. However, to arrive there, I know I must pass through obstacles and challenges. Nevertheless, my emotional influence and perceptions lead me to make sound decisions that will help me avoid obstacles. Emotional influence is a lever of authority that helps me to assess my competence. There is also a connection between emotional influence on perceptions and professional competence. That is, I always bring to my professional work my characteristics, which come from my experiences, biography, and my future obligations (Fisher, 2009).In conclusion, competence is a necessary component in professional practice. I use my professional competence to develop my personnel management knowledge and skills. Additionally, I also use competencies to asses my professional qualifications and performances. Competence is not the same as functional analysis, as competence involves new things such as self-awareness, emotional influence, and ethics, which helps an individual to perform duties and responsibilities correctly. Competence provides the necessary attributes that are essential in professional practices. Additionally, through professional competence, I know that I can respond to a litany of issues, which are common in my professional work.Reference ListCorey, G., Corey, M. S. & Callanan, P. (2011).

ae2a6900,0,"#Social Work Career: Personal Experiences  IntroductionMy desire and interests to help and support those in need started at a tender age. At preschool age, I shared my belongings with vulnerable children. One notable instance that caused trouble between my parents and me was when I insisted we offer my room to a homeless street family we encountered while shopping. My desire and interests have been to be an instrument that promotes the well-being of needy individuals and communities, which I can only be accomplished by pursuing a career in social work.HistoryThe profession of social work in the United States has a long history. According to the National Association of Social Workers, the profession was established in the 19th century. Its primary objective was to equip immigrants and other vulnerable populations with tools and skills to overcome social and economic challenges. Columbia University was the first institution to provide social work classes in 1898. Since then, social workers have been leading in establishing altruistic and private groups that serve people in need. Therefore, I have to pursue a degree in social work to become a licensed social worker.Requirements to Obtain the CareerThe minimum educational requirement for social workers in Texas has several degree levels. They include the Associate Degree in Social Work, Bachelor of Social Work (BSW), Master of Social Work, Doctor of Social Work, and Ph.D. in Social Work. The colleges that offer social work programs in Texas are Wayland Baptist University, University of Houston, Baylor University, University of Texas, Arlington, Tarleton University, and Texas state university. One must have a license to be a social worker. The license requires BSW, the Council of Social Work Education (CSWE), field experience, Texas Jurisprudence Exam, and social worker license exam (Staff Writers). Some jobs related to social work may include community health nurses, therapists, clinical services, and community counselors. Essential skills and competencies for social workers are communication, empathy, organization, advocacy, cultural competence, professional commitment, critical thinking, and patience. Thus, it is essential to know the responsibilities, working environment, salary, and benefits associated with the career.Job PositionThe roles and responsibilities of social workers vary with their job settings. However, the main tasks entail identifying those in need and helping people address and manage their everyday problems. They also advocate for and develop plans for enhancing people’s well-being and work with groups, families, and individuals (Staff Writers). Social workers fit into the organization system since they can offer services in different settings and departments. The working environment ranges from private to public organizations, such as health care facilities and services are offered during the day from 8 am to 5 pm. At the entry-level, social workers report to a regional manager, and no one works below them. The annual salary for a social worker with less than one year of experience ranges from $55,000 to $68,190 (Bureau of Labor Statistics). Some of the benefits entitled to the profession are paid time off (annual and sick leaves), flexible work schedule, full health insurance, a traditional retirement plan, and parental leave. An outlook and reflection on the career can help know possible challenges to encounter, motivation, and demand in the job market.Outlook and ReflectionSocial workers are likely to encounter possible challenges while executing their duties and responsibilities: cultural barriers and inadequate resources to end social problems such as homelessness and family violence. However, individual, family, and community well-being improvements and salary and benefits linked to the profession, which encourages people to continue working. The demand for social workers in Houston, Texas, and Texas, in general, is high. Organizations such as Texas Children’s Hospital and Baylor St. Luke’s Medical Center offer a position for social workers at entry and advanced levels. The career promotes equity and the well-being of all people in society. The motivation, job market demand, and benefits associated with the profession lead to the conclusion about pursuing the career.ConclusionSocial work is one of the professions with numerous benefits to society. It helps equip vulnerable individuals and communities with skills and essential tools to facilitate coping and overcome social and economic challenges. The profession enhances the well-being of all individuals regardless of age, religion, or ethnic affiliation. The career is good for me because it allows me to do what I have been enjoying doing since childhood professionally.Works CitedBureau of Labor Statistics. “National Occupational Employment And Wage Estimates United States”.

969981e9,0,"#Multiple Career Choices in Biosciences -   Careers to Pursue After Completing DegreeI am interested in pursuing a career in food science upon the completion of my studies. In addition, I would like to pursue a career in biotechnology. Particularly, I would like to narrow down on one career. Preferably, a career in genetic engineering suits me in many ways, and it is an area of great importance (Bhuyan 2002, pg. 67).Three Main Factors that Influence this ChoiceIt is notable that training in Bioscience provides learners with intrinsic comprehension of life in various forms. This may include the study of places inhabited by organisms. Furthermore, the training focuses on organisms and other molecules. The knowledge and strategic transferable skills developed as part of the Bioscience training deliver the exceptional foundation for various careers across diverse sectors. I am interested in careers because of the skills that I have gained throughout the training.The training provides skills in quality control, management of manufacturing, product generation, patenting, labelling regulations, and industrial research, among others. In addition, the training has facilitated the development of appropriate skills pertaining to genetic engineering (Bhuyan 2002, pg. 67). The experience gained in studying the application of genetic engineering in animals, plants, and human beings are critical to the decision making processes. The ability to work with other people in areas such as microbiology, immunology, and biotechnology are also critical in the expansion of knowledge in the genetic engineering field. Furthermore, I have always had an interest in engaging in private practice as a consultant in the appropriate areas.Job DescriptionThe area of biotechnology is broad and provide those who are trained in bioscience several opportunities. This paper discusses the field of genetic engineering within the area of biotechnology. Genetic engineering incorporates the transfer of genes between animals in order to eliminate or add unwanted traits or characteristics (Echaore-Mcdavid & Mcdavid 2006, pg. 49). The day-to-day work entailed in genetic engineering entails the removal, transformation, or addition of cell nuclei in order to change the information carried by the genes of such cells.The work environment for genetic engineers normally entails closing laboratory settings with large machinery and equipment used in facilitating the modification of cells (Echaore-Mcdavid & Mcdavid 2006, pg. 49). It is notable that many genetic engineers have presented ethical values as the challenge for working in the field. Genetic engineers normally feelings that using animals in research and the generation of products is unethical. However, they gain satisfaction in their work from their ability to develop products that help millions of people in diverse ways.Potential EmployersIt is notable that genetic engineering falls under the extensive zone of biotechnology. Therefore, biotechnology firms and organizations are likely establishments that can absorb genetic engineers. In addition, the medical field relies on genetic engineering to unearth the nature and characteristics of genetic ailments (Echaore-Mcdavid & Mcdavid 2006, pg. 49). Therefore, genetic engineers can also gain job opportunities in the medical field, where they help comprehend the molecular nature of ailments in order to suggest treatment. In addition, genetic engineers can find work in the criminal justice administration system. The genetic engineers can conduct genetic tests in order to identify suspects in criminal investigations (Echaore-Mcdavid & Mcdavid 2006, pg. 49).Specialist TrainingThe specialized training required for genetic engineers is specifically a graduate degree in genetics. In addition, postgraduate degree holders in genetics have the desirable skills to work as a genetic engineer. Furthermore, qualifications in the same fields as biotechnology and molecular biology at the graduate and postgraduate levels possess the appropriate skills required for genetic engineers (Echaore-Mcdavid & Mcdavid 2006, pg. 49).Volunteer Work and Other ActivitiesGenetic engineers are expected to possess certain skills developed over time through different engagements. It is notable that volunteer opportunities taken up by emerging genetic engineers are crucial to the development of appropriate personal skills. Volunteer opportunities can develop successful genetic engineers (Reed, 2003, pg. 118). They should learn critical skills such as sharp analytical minds, research skills, and attention to detail. Furthermore, learners can develop high concentration levels, imaginative minds, adequate physical strength, teamwork skills, and sound ethical standards.The volunteer work that a potential genetic engineer should have entails gaining experience in the broad field of biotechnology. The significance of volunteering at a biotechnology firm is that one can learn the basic issues in testing and genetic engineering. Therefore, budding genetic engineers who gain experience in a wider area of biotechnology can get into the genetic engineering field.There are notable activities that potential genetic engineers can undertake to acquire the necessary skills for their work. Potential genetic engineers can undertake volunteer work at the courts in order to work as an assistant genetic engineer. The individual can participate in this engagement for a period of six months. The roles of such engagements would include helping in the criminal investigation process in order to link criminals to different crimes. Furthermore, the individual could help the courts in providing evidence from criminals in order to criminalize suspects rightly. The notable obstacles that can hinder one from achieving goals include lack of autonomy in the course of duty. This is possible because volunteering in such a system presents challenges to the independence of an individual.List of BibliographyBhuyan, D 2002, Multiple Career Choices: For Graduate and Post Graduate Courses, Echaore-Mcdavid, S., & Mcdavid, R.

ff0e233d,0,"#Teacher's Impact on Student's Career Choice  It could be stated with certainty that teachers have an immense influence on the development of various outcomes of their students. Moreover, it is possible to observe that a good teacher does not only serve educational purposes, but he or she also shapes their students’ attitude toward career choices and decision-making in life. As it is stated by Saifan et al., “qualitative researchers believe that reality is understood through people sharing experience and interaction with others” (21). The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the teacher who had the greatest impact on me as a person. In order to achieve this goal, the essay will firstly dwell upon the evaluation of the teacher’s input that made a difference for me, and then I will describe how this teacher impacted my life.For the purposes of this paper, I have chosen to write about my school teacher, whose name is changed in order to respect the person’s confidentiality. Kate was my biology teacher during high school, and I can claim with great certainty that this person had the most profound impact on my decision to become a nursing professional. As it is pointed out by Ismail et al., “the teacher’s personality is essential because experiencing the proper pattern of clinical instructor’s behavior is a motivation for educating students” (97).There are several aspects of her work that should be evaluated in order to understand the significance of her influence on me. First of all, she was passionate about the subject she was teaching, and thus she was able to invoke interests among people in the class. Of course, not everyone was involved in the subject to the same extent – some people responded with a greater passion due to their natural aptitude for biology, and I was among these people.The second aspect, which I also consider to be highly important, is that Kate was able to provide us with a vivid description of why the work of a nursing professional is so important and contributing to society. I can suggest that it was one of her most compelling characteristics as a teacher: she was able to connect actual problems of contemporary society with the topics related to biology. This was a great advantage compared to the majority of other teachers, who often seemed detached from real-life problems, being only focused on their subject. Overall, it could be summarized that I evaluate Kate’s teaching style as highly efficient.Since the evaluation is done, it would be appropriate to state that Kate has directly influenced my decision to become a nursing professional. Therefore, it is evident that she had an immense impact on my life because she helped me to make a difficult decision about my future career. She also taught me to think critically, which is one of the most important skills contributing to efficient learning.However, the most important contribution by Kate as a teacher was the following: she had shown me that social problems, including issues in the public health sector, could be efficiently treated by any person who puts enough effort into it. Therefore, I was inspired by Kate to become a nursing professional because I understood that I could be in a position where I can make a difference and help people around me and the society at large. In conclusion, I should state that I highly evaluate my teacher’s contribution to my current perception of life.Works CitedIsmail, Lamia Mohamed-Nabil, et al. “Clinical Instructor’s Behavior: Nursing Student’s Perception toward Effective Clinical Instructor’s Characteristics.” Journal of Nursing Education and Practice, vol. 6, no. 2, 2015, pp. 96-105.Saifan, Ahmad, et al. “Theory Practice Gaps in Nursing Education: A Qualitative Perspective.” Journal of Social Sciences/Sosyal Bilimler Dergisi, vol. 11, no. 1, 2015, pp. 20-29.",1

According to Hall (2004) this few has changed over the past two decades and it is clear that career development is not a onetime choice but rather a lifelong process. Savickas (2012) argues that the form of career intervention must change just like the form of work changes to reflect the labor needs of the twenty-first century. Krumboltz, Foley and Cotter (2013) argues that clients must create more satisfying lives for themselves with the help of counsellors. A model of career counselling, the happenstance learning theory, helps…show more content…There are several factors that determine decision-making, which includes learning experiences, genetic factors, environmental factors and task approach skills (Mitchell & Krumboltz, 1990). According to Krumboltz (2009) happenstance learning theory has four propositions. The first proposition is that “assessments should be used to stimulate learning – not to match personal characteristics with occupational characteristics” (Krumboltz, 2009). According to Schreuder and Coetzee (2011), personality and development are determined by learning experiences. Shoffner (2006) suggests that it is important for clients to realise how important it is to expand their knowledge, skills and interests by learning and adapting to change and it is therefore an important task of the counsellor to encourage the clients to do…show more content…Mitchell and Krumboltz (2012) also argues that a barrier to set goals and to make satisfying choices is to have irrational believes about certain aspects such as career choices and development. Amundson (2009) suggest that clients need to identify these irrational beliefs to move past them and it is therefore important for the career counsellor to help clients identify them. According to the career decision-making theory, the primary focus of decision making and career development is learning through experiences and human interaction (Mitchell & Krumboltz, 2012). The third proposition of the happenstance theory states that it is important to focus on client behaviour (Krumboltz, 2009). “The success of counselling is assessed by what the client accomplishes in the real world outside the counselling session” (Krumboltz, 2009). Mitchell and Krumboltz  (2012) also suggests that to shape the behaviour of clients, positive role models and positive reinforcement can be used by",1

The case study is going to highlight individuals career choices, factors influencing those choices and long life impacts of these choices.FinanceThere are several aspects to consider while making a decision on what career you would like to pursue.Personal interest includes what you like doing and how far you would go to get it. A good example is when someone is in love. One is certain they are right about their career choice when they end up engaging themselves in doing what they truly have a passion for.Amplitude is where you go beyond interest to do something that you have a potential and you are good at. For example, childhood dreams of becoming a doctor. With such ambitions one should be willing to invest in education to attain the necessary qualifications of becoming a doctor.Your personal significance is not right when someone keeps on moving from one job to another simply because they don’t feel comfortable with their choices. This is when you check what really matters to you.Employment and job opportunities – most parents, guardians and sponsors advise scholars to go for careers that fetch more money. This should not be the case, an individual is supposed to involve him/herself in a career path that they have interest in, work hard and earn as much as they can (Hull, 39).A real option identificationA real example of real option is of someone who would want to be a lawyer but at the same time wants to be a doctor. This is a hard decision to make because in both cases the courses take a long period to study. The person may end up losing all their chances not only because they want both careers to pursue but because of the dilemma he/she is in, which is an obstacle for making a wise choice.Option real modelsThe other options that this person has is to become a medical lawyer which was not his passion and which he was never qualified for. In a circumstance like this individual ends up paying more and relocating to other learning institutions.This three dimensional tree for Sx and S2 involves assumptions correlations and adjusting the probabilities of each node that reflect the risk of career choice and the risk of expansion of companies.In the occurrence of probabilities to reflect the risk of career choice over the risk of expansion.There are several underlying risks that will be clear once he or she makes his or her choice:If he/she chooses to go after his/her career it might affect his/her relationship with the spouseIt will also mean that he/she has not only abandoned his/her dreams’ but also has to start a new life (Hull, 66).Since this person decides to be a lawyer, it means that he or she has forsaken all his/her former goals and dreams. Our case character is volatile since he/she chooses to move ahead. He/she also chooses to be near his spouse, who will be studying at the same school. In this decision, there is the show of maturity since he/she does not choose according to his/her own interest but broadened his/her mind to see possibilities in his/her current choice.He/she shows a strong character in making independent choicesSensitivity AnalysisIn a companies growth risks are taken all the time while planning major expansions and hiring new staffs.

This does not guarantee them in success.Interpellations of findingsThe other pricing models that they might use in taking this risk are:Multi-step binomial mode – this is a credit risk measurements and management important in current issues in the modern finance world. There are two major schools of thought for credit risk analysis namely the structural model based on the asset value and the intensely based reduced form of modeling (Hull, 89). The most popular risk model used in practice is the binomial expansion technique.Trinomial model – this is an option pricing model incorporating three possible values within one time period; it is assumed that the value of the underlined asset will be greater or lesser than its current value. This model, on the other hand, incorporates a third possible value which incorporates no change of value over time period.Stochalistic volatility model.Jump diffusion model.After taking this expansion step he found out that the risk was worth taking. He had a preset goal to expand. Risk taking often means standing a chance to lose or be involved in undesired accidents.This table will help you understand how it is approached by the use of a least square analysis to know how the expansion risk between the continuing value and the relevant values from relevant variables.The free risk is 6 percent yearly (Hull, 102). The current expansion purchase is 1.00 and the price for strike is 1.10. Let us look at the money of two years, the investor option must decide whether to execute or not. From the assumption of this path we see:V=a+BS+cs2Whereby S is the purchase price for two years and the continuing value is V, discounting is back to two years.

There are so many factors that go into why someone is paid more than someone else that it could be said because of so many of these factors that a wage gap does not exist at all. Throughout the paper wage gap will be explored and how choices both men and women make factor into the pay gap. Also how a wage gap may not exist and it all lies in choices made by both genders, but the most common idea of discrimination towards women could also be a factor in pay differences. How Career Choices Affect the Pay Gap. Choices… this could be the reason that a “wage…show more content…As explained in the first paragraph it is all up to the choices made by each gender. There are many factors that go into doing the calculations for finding the wage gap between genders and among choices that are made regarding career there are also choices that are uncontrollable like being unemployed.  In a study by the Journal of Labor Economics (2008) it was discovered that “women tend on average to be more positively selected into work than men. However, the difference between actual and potential wage gaps is small...where the gender employment gap is highest.” (P. 625). This piece of evidence is very important because when calculating for the wage gap unemployment is also taken into factor and there is a big gender employment gap with more women not in jobs. This means women will be earning less money when averaged with men because more men have jobs. Many women are out of work for many reasons such as family matters and still in a patriarchal society today men are seen as the “breadwinners” of families however, society is ever changing. Besides unemployment another major factor that goes into the so called wage gap are women's choices in jobs as well as the responsibilities many women are felt they need to take on as well as a career. In a paper by Watson (2017) the author states “Primarily, women are more likely to take time off work for childcare, leading to less experience and fewer opportunities for career growth later in life. Some blame oppressive societal gender roles for urging women to be the caretakers of the home, but the reality is that women are less likely to devote the majority of their lives to their careers -- leading to fewer overall wage earnings.” (P. 1). These factors such as being caretakers at home are reasons why when wage gap is calculated it is seen that women are earning less than men but as explained because some women do not devote themselves to",1

The majority of people assume bottled water is superior to tap water. One possible reason people are attracted to bottled water is bottled water companies have fancy labels promising the purest and freshest water. Some people deem drinking bottled water to be sophisticated. However, at what cost will people sacrifice their financial security, environmental condition, and health? One of the many benefits of tap water is it is extremely cheap, in particular when compared to bottled water. The cost of bottled water is 500-2,000 times more than tap water. “Drinking 64 ounces per day of bottled water could cost well over $1,000 per year. Those same 64 ounces per day in tap water would cost less than fifty cents for the whole year!” (Bottled Water and Water Conservation).

Eliminating the plastic bottle will protect humans against these toxic chemicals. Tap water has substantial evidence to support it. Tap water is less susceptible to the effects of toxic chemicals than bottled water and overall superior to bottled water.

7965c0b5,1,"#Environmental impact of the life cycle of tap water with the life cycle of glass bottled waterAbstractIn this report, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology is applied to compare the lifecycle of tap water and bottled water using the four assessment methods. The results of inventory analysis and impact assessment shows that the tap water and glass bottled water production processes play an important role in almost all of the analysed parameters. The processes that have was examined include production and transportation, the quantification of the energy used and the potential contributions to impact categories was also evaluated.It was realised that the glass bottle water production shows a relatively higher energy requirement as well as overall higher contribution to environmental impact in Climate change, ozone layer, Exotoxicity, acidification/eutrophication, respiratory organics, respiratory inorganics, radiation, carcinogens, land use and minerals.1:IntroductionPresently, industries and businesses are assessing how their activities affect the environment due to increases environmental awareness. Also, the Society is becoming more concerned about the issues of natural resource depletion and environmental degradation and many industries have responded to this awareness by providing “sustainable” products and using “sustainable” processes. Drinking water is a basic necessity, but how can this basic need be satisfied in an environmentally friendly manner. This analysis compares the entire life cycle from the water extraction to serving it up in a glass bottle in a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).The systems that have been assessed in this study are: the production of inputs of tap water and glass bottle, transportation, energy used and the manufacturing process. This study was carried out with the use of the SimaPro 7 software for the inventory and interpretation of the analysis.Eco-indicator 99 (l) V2.02/Europe El 99 l/l was used as an assessment method in which the various materials and products are weighted with regard to the impact caused by them to the environment.2:Benefits of conducting Life Cycle Assessment* Life cycle analysis encourages a more informed and broader view of the environmental impact of a product. It helps decision-makers select the product or process that results in the least impact to the environment. This information can be used alongside other factors, such as cost and performance data to select a product or process.* LCA helps to avoids generalisations about the environmental performance of a product in isolation to its total life cycle. Rather, it openly acknowledges the assumptions made, and tests the effects of the assumptions.* LCA allows producers and consumers to compare relatively, the significance of different types of environmental impacts with caution.* LCA helps to avoid the Shifting environmental problems from one place to another; It allows a decision maker to study an entire product system thus, avoiding a sub-optimization that could result if only a single process were the focus of the study. For example, when choosing between two rival products, it may appear that product A is better for the environment because it generates less solid waste than product B. Get Help With Your EssayIf you need assistance with writing your essay, our professional essay writing service is here to help!Essay Writing ServiceHowever, after performing an LCA it might be discovered that the first product actually creates larger cradle-to-grave environmental impacts when measured across all three media i.e. air, land and water e.g. it may cause more emissions of chemicals during its manufacturing stage. Therefore, the second product that produces solid more waste may be viewed as producing less cradle-to-grave environmental harm or impact than the first technology due its lower chemical emissions.This ability to track and document shifts in environmental impacts of products can help decision makers to fully characterize the environmental trade-offs associated with product alternatives.By conducting an LCA, analysts will be able to;* Analyze the environmental trade-offs associated with one or more specific products to help gain stakeholder’s acceptance for a planned action.* Quantify the environmental emissions to air, water, and land in relation to each life cycle stage and the major contributing process.* Develop an efficient assessment of the environmental consequences associated with a given product.3:Challenges encountered in conducting Life Cycle AssessmentPerforming an LCA could be time and resource intensive. Depending on how comprehensive the user wishes to conduct, gathering the data can be problematic, and the availability of data can greatly impact on the accuracy of the final results. Therefore, it is important to consider the availability of data, the time required to accomplish the study, and the financial resources necessary against the anticipated benefits of the LCA. Table 1 below shows the general challenges of LCA.Table 1:The general challenges and difficulties of LCA methodology.Goal definition and scopingIn conducting an LCA, the cost may be prohibitive to small firms; also, the required time to conduct LCA may exceed product development constraints especially for short development cycles; the temporal and spatial magnitude of a dynamic product system are complex to address; definition of functional units for the evaluation of design alternatives can be problematic; allocation methods used in defining system boundaries have inherent weaknesses; complex products (e.g. automobiles) entails huge resources to analyse.Data collectionAvailability of data and access can be limiting e.g. proprietary data; data quality, including bias, precision completeness and accuracy ,are frequently not well addressed.Data EvaluationSophisticated models and model parameters for evaluating resource depletion, human health and ecosystem, may not be available or their ability to represent the product system may be repulsive. Thus most times, uncertainty analyses of the results are often not conducted.Information transferDesign decision-makers often lack knowledge about environmental effects, and aggregation and simplification techniques may distort results. Synthesis of environmental effect categories is limited because they are incommensurable.According to (Keoleian, 2003)”Both cost and time constraints currently limit thepractice of LCA”. Most small companies are not likely to be able to afford specializing in LCA and even for larger firms, the benefits of investment in LCA may not be apparent immediately. In some cases, possible cost savings may not be identified unless full cost accounting systems have been instituted.Therefore, in other for it to be more cost effective, it should be incorporated into the existing environmental management system and information systems within a firm.Also, LCA will not conclude on which product is the most cost effective or works the best. Therefore, the information developed in an LCA should be used as one component of a more comprehensive decision process in assessing the trade-offs with cost and performance, an example is Life Cycle Management.4:Present quality examples of uses of LCA.One example of the uses of Life cycle assessment is its application in the pulp and paper industry. Life cycle assessment is used to compare the environmental impact of the use of two kinds of fuel i.e. heavy fuel oil and natural gas, in the pulp and paper production process.Another, LCA methodology can be applied to agricultural production. An example is the Life cycle analysis of sugar beet production using different forms of nitrogen fertilizers. It could be used in this aspect to quantify and evaluate the impact of the choice of different N fertilisers on the environmental burden associated with the sugar beet production system.Also, it could be applied in the bakery industry. An example is the life cycle analysis of bread production by comparing homemade bread or industrial bread. In this context, it could be used to compare the environmental effects of producing bread at home or at the bakery showing which type of bread production has less environmental effects and how the environmental effects can be reduced.5:Guidance and LCA standardsThere are international standard which help us undertake LCAs in a standard way.The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies) and the ISO technical committees produce international standards on a variety of topics.The ISO 14000 seriesThe ISO 14000 series relates to numerous facets of environmental management. These series includes ISO 14040 – 14043 and they were prepared by the Technical Committee ISO/TC 207, Environmental Management Subcommittee SC 5, Life Cycle Assessment. While ISO recognizes that LCA is still in a growing stage of development, ISO 14040-14043 is a consensus-based, voluntary set of standards pertaining to LCA.ISO 14040 – Environmental management – Life cycle assessment – Principles and framework: Specifies the general framework, principles, and requirements for conducting and reporting life cycle assessment studies, but does not describe the life cycle assessment technique in detail.ISO 14041 – Environmental management – Life cycle assessment – Goal scope and definition and inventory analysis: Specifies the requirements and procedures for the compilation and preparation of the definition of goal and scope for an LCA and for performing, interpreting, and reporting a life cycle inventory (LCI) analysis.ISO 14042 – Environmental management – Life cycle assessment – Life cycle impact assessment: Describes and gives guidance on the general framework for the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) phase of LCA, and the key features and inherent limitations of LCIA. It specifies requirements for conducting the LCIA phase and the relationship of LCIA to other LCA phases.ISO 14043 – Environmental management – Life cycle assessment – Life cycle interpretation: Provides requirements and recommendations for conducting the life cycle interpretation in LCA or LCI studies. It does not describe specific methodologies for the life cycle interpretation phase of LCA and LCI studies.(Dooley, 2002)ISO 14040:2006 Environmental management – Life Cycle Assessment – Principles and frameworkPAS2050:2008 – Specification for the assessment of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of goods and services(Patterson, 2009)These standards set out the general process that should be followed when undertaking any Life Cycle Assessment and are not legally binding or enforceable.6:Methodological framework6.1:General requirementsThis analysis was performed using a methodological framework based on ISO (International Organization for Standardization) recommendations stated above and according to ISO, there are four phases in LCA: goal and scope definition, inventory analysis, impact assessment and interpretation.6.2:Goal and scope definition6.2.1: PurposeThe purpose of this study is the identification and assessment of the environmental impacts associated with the production, use, disposal and recycling of tap water and glass bottle water.The main reason for conducting this study is to compare the environmental impact of the life cycle of tap water with the life cycle of glass bottled water, to provide information on which of production processes has less environmental impact, to understand which of the processing stages account for the highest or lowest environmental effects and to evaluate how the environmental impacts can be reduced.6.2.2: Functional Unit (FU)The main purpose of the functional unit is to provide a reference unit to which the inventory data are normalised. In this assessment, the appropriate functional unit of water is related to 1 kg of portable water to be consumed and the equivalent amount which is 750 grams of water in the bottle6.2.3:Study QuestionsThe study seeks to answer the following questions:* What are the environmental impacts of tap water and glass bottle production?* What are the different materials used in the manufacture of these two products?* Which of the production processes has less environmental impact?6.2.4: Product descriptionThe products being assessed are glass bottle and tap water. The raw material used in the production of glass bottle are dolomite, sand, feldspar, limestone, silica sand, natural gas, 2 litres of water and electricity while the raw material used in the production of the tap water are water from lakes, water from river and underground water, chlorine, hydrogen peroxide, ozone, charcoal and electricity.6.2.5: Product system boundariesThe system being assessed produces glass bottle water and tap water using the typical life cycle stages.* Cradle to material production for glass bottle and reuse.* Treatment and distribution of tap water.6.2.6:Process flow chartsThe process flow for the glass bottle is represented in figure 1 below and it includes the following; Water, dolomite, soda, limestone, feldspar, sand, silica sand, natural gas, electricity, transport and waste disposal (land filling and recycling).Figure 3:The network of the Life cycle analysis of the glass bottled water.Figure 4:The network of the Life cycle analysis of the tap water.6.4.2:Impact Assessment of the tap water and glass bottle waterThe comparison is made up of the environmental impact of glass bottled water and tap water.For the glass bottle water, the environmental impact is also determined by the power requirements, the basic infrastructure and in this case, the waste disposal scenario is taken into consideration which involves the recycling of the glass. The power requirements and basic infrastructures includes; Electricity, soda powder at the plant, natural gas, transport, manufacturing of the empty white glass bottle and assembly of glass bottle full of water.The analysis of the inventory carried out for the tap water shows that the environmental impact of tap water is determined by power requirements and by the basic infrastructure i.e. the electricity production medium, the pump station, portable water , water supply network and supply of water. By contrast, the recycling equipment used in water treatment is less relevant in this context. The power consumption figures (percentages) are relatively accurate as they make a 100%.Eco Eco-indicator 99 (l) V2.02/Europe El 99 l/l method was used in this study with regards to all the impact categories.For each of the two systems analysed using the SimaPro 7 LCA software, the potential contribution to climate change, ozone layer, Exotoxicity, acidification/eutrophication, respiratory organics, respiratory inorganics, radiation, carcinogens, land use and minerals are characterized. The results are presented below in histograms and in tables.Generally there are 3 steps in Life Cycle Inventory Analysis, namely:* Classification and characterization,* Normalization, and* WeightingClassification and characterization are mandatory element while normalization and weighting are optional elements (Guinee, 2002; Hauschild, Jeswiet, & Alting, 2005; ISO14000, 2000).6.4.3:CharacterisationChart 1:The characterisation under impact assessment for the life cycle analysis of the glass bottle.According to the characterisation chart above, the environmental impact is at the waste disposal scenario and assemble of glass bottle full of water but less at the transport process for all the impact categories.Table 4:Table showing the characterisation result of the impact category in glass bottled waterClimate change Climate change is the change in the statistical distribution of weather over a period of time ranging from decades to millions of years.

When the values are normalized, comparison between impacts can be made. From chart 3 below, It was found that the main impact is from the assembly of glass bottle full of water. The main substances that contributed to this impact are; Carbon dioxide, fossil, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, lead, nitrogen oxides, particulates and sulphur oxide emissions that occurred during the manufacturing of the empty white glass bottle. The second impact is the waste disposal, this impact is caused during the waste scenario. The third impact being transport caused due to emission from the lorry taking the bottles to the retailer.Chart 3:The normalisation under impact assessment for the life cycle of glass bottled waterTable 6: The normalisation under impact assessment for the glass bottled water.Chart 4: The normalisation under impact assessment for the life cycle of tap waterFrom the chart 4 above, It was found that the main impact is from the supply of water.

Followed by waste disposal and transport impact.Chart 5: The weighting under impact assessment for the life cycle of glass bottled waterTable 8:The weighting under impact assessment for the glass bottled waterChart 6:The weighting under impact assessment for the life cycle of tap waterBased on table 8 below, the weighting under impact assessment for the life cycle of the tap water is given the same as the normalization. The main impact from the supply of water. The main substances that contributed to this impact are aluminium, chloride and chlorine emissions that occurred during the production of the portable water.Table 9:The weighting under impact assessment for the tap waterConclusion / RecommendationFrom the analysis conducted, tap water contributed the least damage to the environment while glass bottle contributed the highest damage to this category. However, tap water still contributed even at a moderate effect and efforts are needed based on reducing the damages that could happen.Thus, from an environmental point of view, tap water is generally preferable to glass bottled water. If, as an exception, bottled water is consumed, its production process is much more relevant for its environmental impact than its assembly.Among the impacts identified are;* The empty glass bottles production process contributes damages to the human health and the ecosystem quality.* The electricity generation process which uses natural gas has reduced the natural resource.To overcome these problems, suggestions of corrections are as follows:1. The use of plastic bottles water to replace the glass bottle water2. The reliance on natural gas for electricity generation is suggested to be combined with other two types of renewable electricity generation namely:* Using 25% solar energy (considering most manufacturing industries to divert into the use of solar energy).* Using 25% hydro-electric energy 25% considering the fact that electricity could be generated from the flowing water in the water treatment plant.* Using 50% natural gas.",1

9049f0ac,1,"#Motivations to Choose Bottled Water -   Report ExampleIntroductionBottled water is considered one of the fastest-selling liquid commodities on the planet today (Elmhirst, 2016). A report by DÇruiz (2015) shows that its sales numbers have outpaced those of milk, sugary soft drinks, and alcohol. The growth of the bottled water industry is attracting a lot of global attention because more companies are jostling to have a significant share of the market. However, it is difficult to attract customers who are spoilt for choice to a market that largely offers the same thing. In this paper, the motivations for choosing different bottled water brands, among a selection of companies, are highlighted. However, before delving into this matter, the section below provides a background of the bottled water industry.BackgroundThe bottled water industry is a multibillion-dollar economic sector that has taken many observers by surprise (Elmhirst, 2016). Indeed, it is ironic that a commodity, which is commonly available in many countries, could create such a lucrative industry (Elmhirst, 2016). Although few companies which sell bottled water make significant changes to this precious commodity, consumers are willing to pay a lot of money to have it. Today, it is almost impossible to find offices without bottled water dispensers and people working out without a bottle of water in their hands. In some homes, people still choose to buy the commodity despite having water flowing through their taps.Additionally, they choose to do so despite many local authorities guaranteeing that the water flowing through their taps is safe to drink. These dynamics have created an interesting, but lucrative, demand for a common commodity that many cannot do without. The sheer size of the market is more attractive to prospective companies because the market is big enough for everyone. However, the problem most companies experience is that they are all selling the same product. Therefore, the only viable platform for competing with rivals is through the adoption of successful marketing techniques. Different attributes associated with the concept (marketing) influence how consumers make their purchasing decisions. The section below highlights three key marketing attributes that influence the motivation to choose one brand of bottled water over another.MotivationsPricingPricing is considered one of the essential components of marketing. Therefore, it is not surprising that it would inform the decision-making. Consumers often prefer to buy products from companies that offer affordable bottled water to those that sell the commodity expensively. Indeed, some people say that pricing is one area of marketing bottled water where most companies choose to compete (“Companies are racing to add value to water,” 2017). Those that offer the lowest prices tend to get the largest share of the market, while companies that price their water at a premium are often confined to a niche market (“Companies are racing to add value to water,” 2017). A low price strategy is possibly beneficial to consumers in the short run, but in the long run, companies that are unable to adjust their operational costs accordingly are likely to be negatively affected by it.AdvertisementAdvertisement is often touted as an important marketing concept for different types of businesses because it always keeps customers engaged and invested in products (TMM, 2017). Additionally, it could redefine people’s perception of a product, or service, based on the kind of value customers get from it. The bottled water industry is subject to the same motions because advertisement has a huge impact on how consumers view a product. Generally, companies that advertise innovatively are likely to get more attention from customers than those that do not. Additionally, companies that are innovative in how they produce their bottled water are also likely to get more sales than those that do not do so (“Companies are racing to add value to water,” 2017). The concept of advertisement could mean different things for the bottled water industry. However, in the context of this study, this concept mostly means how companies package their products to appeal to specific market segments. Water is simply water. However, adding value to it through advertisement could mean the difference between a sale and the lack thereof.Quality/SafetyThe quality and safety of anything consumed are often of the utmost importance to consumers. Consequently, buyers are often specific about the kind of products they choose to purchase. Although the bottled water market is a highly regulated industry, companies that adhere to higher safety and quality standard are more likely to attract more consumers than those that do not (FDA, 2017). The importance of making sure only quality and safe products are bought stems from accusations that some bottled water companies are simply taking free water from the tap and selling it to customers at a profit. Some vendors are notorious for false advertisements, whereby they make claims that their water is sourced from springs, but it emerges not to be the case. These incidences draw our attention to quality and safety issues, which would otherwise inform a customer’s decision regarding which bottled water brand to buy (International Bottled Water Association, 2017). Companies that strive to maintain high quality and safety standards are likely to get higher traffic of customers than those that do not.Comparison/AnalysisAccording to this paper, advertisement, price, and the quality of bottled water influence the motivation to purchase the commodity from different companies. The quality of water processing emerges as the top reason with the highest effect on purchasing decisions because quality supersedes the most superficial aspects of marketing, such as price and innovation. Price would be the next most important issue to consider in this paper when selecting bottled water brands, followed by advertisements.The three motivating factors highlighted above fit within Philip Kotler’s model of marketing, which frames marketing concepts within 4Ps – price, product, place, and promotion (TMM, 2017). Price is highlighted in this paper as a motivating factor for selecting the most appropriate bottled water brand. It directly applies to the first “P,” which demonstrates that consumers would be partly persuaded by the price of products or services when making purchasing decisions. The quality of bottled water is also highlighted in this paper as another motivating factor for the purchase of the commodity. Kotler’s second “P” – product – represents it.According to Kotler, the nature and value of different products, or services, often dictate the appeal they will have on the market (TMM, 2017). The need for developing products and services that suit a customer’s specification is integral to this analysis because customers are generally likely to buy products that fulfill their desires (TMM, 2017). In the context of this study, products that are of high quality would have the highest appeal, partly because many people who buy bottled water are often health-conscious. Therefore, the quality of bottled water they buy often matters.Lastly, innovation is another motivating factor highlighted in this paper that influences the decision regarding which brand to buy. Innovation is covered in Kotler’s last “P” – promotion. The strategies adopted by bottled water companies to market their products would come to focus in this space because, although they are selling the same products, customers would be more attracted to advertisements or campaigns that appeal to a specific attribute they are interested in. For example, a bottled water company that has a youthful bottle design, or that markets itself as such, would find more appeal among this demographic. Similarly, a company that focuses on the functionality of its products would attract customers who are interested in the same. Based on this fact, the advertisement would be a motivating factor for people to buy a specific type of bottled water brand.Generally, the three attributes highlighted in this paper show that advertisement, price, and product quality are important motivating factors that influence the decision to purchase a specific brand of bottled water. Kotler explained these motivations in his 4Ps framework. Although the concept of “place” does not apply to this study, price, promotion, and product are explained. The main power of influence that these three influencing factors have on people’s decision to choose a bottled water brand is their appeal to people’s need to get quality products at the right price and for the right person. This core thread of analysis informs the motivation to choose the right bottle brand.According to Kotler’s 4Ps of marketing, there is no clear distinction regarding which of the four key categories of marketing is superior or more impactful in purchasing decisions. However, in this paper, price appears to have a greater significance for consumer purchasing decisions because of the uniformity of the product sold – water. If the product sold had a differentiating factor, the price would seize to have the same impact. However, this is not the case. Product quality emerges as the second most important factor that influences the motivation to buy a specific brand of water.This is because quality and safety concerns are at the top of the list of many consumers in this market segment (International Bottled Water Association, 2017). Furthermore, many customers who consume bottled water tend to be health-conscious. This is why they prefer this type of water to tap water. Advertisement is the least impactful attribute of influencing consumers to purchase bottled water because it appeals to the superficial aspects of marketing that could fail to gain traction or hold for a long period. Nonetheless, the aforementioned ranking does not take away from the fact that all the three factors highlighted have a significant impact on the motivation to choose a specific brand of bottled water.ConclusionIn this study, the peculiarities of the bottled water market are seen to have captured the attention of analysts who have expressed their amusement at the fact that a commodity, which is readily available in many homes, has evolved into a million dollar business. Companies are trying to meet the demand for this product in the ever-expanding market, regardless of the fact that they are all selling the same commodity. The future of this industry is largely dictated by the decision of consumers to buy a specific type of bottled water brand. In this paper, advertisement, price, and product quality/safety emerge as the top motivating factors that influence such a decision. Therefore, companies that want to outwit their competitors in this market need to concentrate on them.",1

Besides, (Ferrier 2001)   goes ahead to indicate that quality of water coming from the taps is checked routinely for any suspicious particles and chemicals. This is not the case for bottled water. First, as Doria (2010) notes, twenty to twenty-five percent of the bottled water comes directly from tap water without any form of purification through distillation of any other treatment. This means that 25 to 40 percent of the bottled water is not any different from the tap water only that it has been exposed to or has a high concentration of the chemicals used to manufacture the packaging plastics.  Due to the pathetically primitive regulation of the bottled water, the manufacturers are not keen to inform the consumers of the contaminants that are present in their water. According to Warburton (1993), consumers are likely to drink bottled water containing contaminants such as E.coli, asbestos, giardia, bromate and many other industrial chemicals and pathogens. Arnold & Larsen (2006) indicate that ten water brands in the US had thirty-eight…show more content…This is especially the opinion and suggestion of all bottling companies. According to Doria (2006), the convenience associated with the bottled water is because bottled water is portable. In addition, Doria (2006) notes that bottled water is always available and can be bought in any destination. A company like Nestle sells water in almost all countries. Besides, as indicated by Arnold & Larsen (2006), there is a general perception that the tap water goes under thorough purification before the actual packaging. Those in support of the bottled water also indicate that tap water is cheap and affordable.  Although some of these arguments are true, they cannot justify bottled water as a better option than the tap water. First, although the bottled water is available in all destination, tap water is also found in every location served by the municipality. In fact, as Arnold & Larsen (2006) indicate, most people consume the bottled water not because it is convenient, but because they believe it is safe.  As mentioned earlier, the safety of the bottled water is even questionable because of the limited regulation of the sector. In addition, even though the bottled water is economically friendly in terms of prices, the tap water is more cost",1

Inn conclusion, these could result in efficient approaches to waste bottle disposal, provision of clean water in harmony with environmental and cultural environment and effective policy formulation and enforcement.IntroductionMany and divergent views have been held over time by consumers of bottled water. Specifically, bottled water consumers have regarded this water as safe and of good quality for consumption. This belief has generated a chain of environmental and cultural concerns for policy makers and enforcers over the production and ineffective disposal methods.The research will focus on the impact and enforcement of disposal policies and environmental pollution, conduct an investigation into various areas, analyze different research methods, analyze research methods and draw conclusions from the study for effective approaches to environmental conservation in harmony with the cultural environment.The research will come up with strategic approaches to enforcing policies for environmental conservation, excellent and alternative methods of bottled water manufacture and better and viable alternatives for fuel saving in the production process.BodyThesis statement: Bottled water has had diverse environmental and cultural impacts spanning policy formulation and enforcement strategies. According to Hall (2007, p. 7), bottled water is a widely consumed product. This is an industry that many companies have strategically invested in. The wide usages of these products have environmental and cultural consequences that need to be addressed.According to Goodman (2009, p.3), waste bottles when ineffectively disposed of litter and lead to environmental pollution that in the end become both culturally and environmentally destructive. This concern and the approaches used to manufacture these bottles is a course for concern to the researcher. In addition to that, the quest to provide quality water and efficient manufacturing processes and policy enforcement strategies will be the basis of the research.The specific audience will span policy makers and law enforcement agencies, environmental conservation groups and agencies, manufacturing and recycling companies, water bottling companies and individual consumers.To effectively formulate and implement policies for environmental conservation, the research will analyze the impact of those policies, analyze the quality of water in these bottles, the extent to which current bottle disposal approaches have polluted the environment, analyze consumer behavior and attitudes, company manufacturing and packaging methods, and critically look at available literature spanning all aspects of culture, the environment, and water consumption (Sharfstein, 2010, p. 1).ConclusionAccording to the research proposal, an analysis of the environmental impact of disposing waste water bottles, disposal methods, manufacturing methods, policy formulation and enforcement in the manufacturing methods and use of these bottles, and the quality of water sold out to the consumer formed the backbone of the research.In addition to that, various cultural attachments and consumer attitudes besides the recycling strategies and possible alternatives or efficient recycling methods and efficient fuel usage in the whole process was a vital consideration in the research.Reference ListGoodman, S.

668a3eac,1,"#FIJI Water: The Leading Producer of Bottled Water -    IntroductionFIJI Water is one of the leaders in the market of bottled water globally. The company experienced rapid growth during the 1990s-2000s due to a successful marketing strategy and increased interest in bottled water in a variety of markets (McMaster & Nowak, 2009). At the same time, the company is now facing several issues that require urgent measures to be undertaken.Thus, growing environmental concerns across the globe have led to extensive criticism from numerous environmental and conservational organizations and activists stressing that bottled water was a waste of natural resources as well as people’s money.FIJI Water responded to such accusations by implementing a project aimed at investigating the negative impact of the company’s operations as well as diminishing these effects. Admittedly, the company has to meet people’s expectations as in case it fails, FIJI Water may lose its favorable image and, eventually, make a loss as people will simply stop buying its products.The US-based company also has tensions with the Fijian government that has introduced an increased tax that is likely to lead to a decrease in profit. The company has to solve this issue as the inability to comply with local laws may result in the plant’s closure. At the same time, the overall corporate culture and the company’s contribution to the development of the community are rather effective.Critical Ethical IssuesIndividual Ethical IssuesThe difficulties mentioned above are hazardous for the performance and even survival of the company and are associated with ethical issues that can be found at different levels. First, certain individual ethical issues arise. McMaster and Nowak (2009) note that FIJI Waters launched a campaign aimed at tracing the level of the company’s sustainability.Thus, employees involved in this project may try to contribute to a positive image of a company and falsify research data, which is a common solution to an ethical dilemma in organizations (Baines & Fill, 2014). Executives may also try to bribe some Fijian lawmakers to solve the tax issue.Organizational Ethical IssuesAs far as the organizational level is concerned, FIJI Water may get involved in unethical conduct. It may distort data of research on its operations to prove its focus on sustainable practice. McFarlin and Sweeney (2014) note that falsification of data (especially data on economic performance) is still a global ethical issue. It is also noteworthy that FIJI Water may focus on its corporate benefits and take advantage of local people decreasing investment into communities to respond to possible losses associated with new taxation. The company declares its responsible attitude towards locals but this information should be monitored continually.Ethical Issues for SocietyApart from this, ethical issues for society also arise. Hence, societies, where people buy the company’s product, will have to decide whether they need to show off their status or focus on environmental issues. In other words, the society that claims its adherence to such values as sustainability will have to reveal its readiness to ignore bottled water produced in a non-sustainable manner. Furthermore, the Fijian society will have to decide whether they are ready to enjoy short-term benefits and ignore such long-term outcomes as possible lack of natural resources in the future. To date, societies reveal their unpreparedness to follow sustainable principles.Ethical FrameworksThese issues need specific attention and the use of at least two ethical frameworks. First, it is necessary to note that utilitarianism can help effectively address the issues. The framework is based on the principle of “the greater good for the greatest number of people” (Ferrell, Fraedrich & Ferrell, 2014, p. 157).Admittedly, people start companies to make a profit but contemporary businesses have to be responsible. Social responsibility is, actually, one of the most important advantages of an organization and people eagerly buy from such companies. Hence, FIJI Water has to focus on the greatest good for its customers as well as the Fijian society. The company may have to sacrifice a certain amount of its considerable profits to invest in research, truly sustainable methods, and the development of communities (including compromises with the government).Besides, human rights frameworks should be employed as well. This approach focuses on people’s rights. Again, FIJI Water has to consider its practices and operations to make sure people’s rights are manifested. Hence, people have the right to get appropriate salaries for their labor and they have the right to live in adequate conditions as well (which can be achieved through a variety of sustainable programs and proper taxation). Finally, people have the right to know what kind of products they buy and make their choice based on comprehensive information. Therefore, the company has to ensure transparency of its operations.Relevant Law and Company PolicyThe present case shows the tension that may appear between a company and a country’s government. Thus, in November 2008, the government of Fiji introduced the so-called, water resource tax. The law set a fixed tax per liter of water extracted. It is necessary to note that the company negatively accepted the law though FIJI Water has to comply with it as the period of tax-free operations terminated.Notably, a similar law was introduced earlier that year and it led to a highly negative reaction of the company that closed some facilities and started certain campaigns involving other water producers and media aimed at opposing the law. Nonetheless, it is also clear that the law was fair since the company utilized the country’s resources water, roads, land, and human workforce (McMaster & Nowak, 2009). Compliance with local laws also contributes to the development of a favorable image.ConclusionIn conclusion, it is possible to apply the three-part model to identify the most efficient solutions. When it comes to economic solutions, the company has to understand that the image of a socially responsible company has to be sustained. The organization’s profitability depends on its ability to maintain this image. To do so, the company has to meet its standards and diminish its negative effect on the environment. As far as ethical solutions are concerned, the organization has to apply utilitarianism and human rights framework.People (especially local communities) have to have the opportunity to live in appropriate conditions and receive adequate payment for their input. As for the legal solutions, FIJI Water has to comply with the law introduced by the Fijian government as it is fair since the company makes considerable profits and utilizes significant resources. It is possible to conclude that if the company applies these solutions, FIJI Water is likely to remain one of the leading producers of bottled water in the world and will be an exemplary global company that is truly socially responsible.Reference ListBaines, P., & Fill, C.

d865268d,1,"#""Vitamin-Enriched"" Bottled Water: PEST Analysis -   Report ExampleIntroductionThe new “vitamin-enriched” bottled water to be launched in the market requires a critical environmental analysis to guarantee its success in the realms of sales and market penetration. Since the target market segment includes athletes aged between 10 and 30, the PEST (political, economic, social, and technological factors) analysis will facilitate the study of the market’s external environment (Birkholz 43). Fundamentally, any product, which intends to succeed in the market, must observe numerous micro and macro environmental forces so as to stay competitive. Evidently, numerous businesses globally have identified, scrutinized, and adopted their respective environmental forces capable of affecting their endeavors. These signify the aspects and provisions of PEST in a business venture, which relates to the aspects of identifying, studying, and ceasing opportunities in virgin markets with creativity, risk taking tendencies, and novelty.Political FactorsPolitical factors affect businesses considerably. It is a critical necessity in setting up and operating a new venture. The prospected product must consider the political factors within the intended locality, region, or internationally in order to offer a relevant, legal, and meaningful business. Government policies and political forces tend to affect the nature and orientation of any product in the marketplace (Wiegel 163). A new product must consider what provisions the territorial government intends to offer for the businessmen and to what extent. Considering such provisions will ensure that the intended product (vitamin-enriched bottled water) thrives within the market and the industry at large.Considering such provisions will ensure that the concerned organization understands its environment better; hence, can make critical business decisions in regard to business trends and political requirements. Evidently, this factor considers the degree of intervention that respective governments allow within the market. Concurrently, this will allow the concerned business to know what business is legalized within a given territory and which ones cannot perform. These issues will help a new venture in making critical business decisions before investing massively in a business and introducing the new product (vitamin-enriched bottled water) in the market. As a macro environmental factor, political factors thrive to provide the market with the business frameworks and the recommended stipulations. Political factors can affect numerous business provisions and sales of certain products as indicated before. This includes infrastructure, the nature of the workforce, education within the territory and other social factors that are necessary for a new venture. A new product in the market requires viable infrastructural provision, which is a key factor in any meaningful business. The way the product will perform in the market is a subject of political influences.Economic FactorsNew products require considerable economic provisions for their survival. Precisely, economic factor is a key issue required in setting up and operating new businesses and promoting new products. Evidently, the organization will have to consider the aspects of interest rates charged by the immediate financial institutions. Such interest scale might influence the nature of businesses to be operated within a given environment. It will also affect the price of the vitamin-enriched bottled water. Additionally, it is crucial to consider how the government policies will influence the economic factors within a business territory. It is the mandate of every business to observe the interest rates charged by the financial institutions. This might influence the aspects of borrowing critical capitals for running businesses and manufacturing the new product in large quantities to meet the growing market demands. Higher interest rate might disfavor the new business hence will affect the growth and sales of the new product.Another requirement worth consideration in the economic factors incorporates the general economic growth of a country/region as it influences the buying trends of the targeted customers. For instance, economic crisis will affect the sales of the new product if not properly managed. Additionally, economic factors influence the business trends and the market nature. Precisely, the economy of the nation will obviously affect the expenses, revenues, and other business provisions (Birkholz 65). From this argument, new products in the market must consider the economic aspects of the targeted country. An important provision in this context relates to the aspects of economic growth and other viable opportunities in the economic realms. Precisely, viable economic growth translates to higher incomes of the citizens with subsequent increase in demands of the company’s products. This will eventually increase the revenues and profitability of the concerned business. Thus, it is crucial for a new venture to consider the economic aspects of a given country before investing heavily in the vitamin-enriched bottled water.Another important economic consideration is the inflation rates of a country. New businesses require stable economic progresses with limited inflation cases. Higher inflation rates mean that employees of any organization will demand escalated wages and cost of operations will also be higher. Additionally, the demands for the vitamin-enriched bottled water will diminish leading to massive losses to the business. Another factor worth consideration is the exchange rates of a given currency when compared to the rest. Loose and fluctuating currency value might affect the sales of vitamin-enriched bottled water tremendously especially when it is marketed and sold internationally. The conversion rates might reduce the net income of the business. Precisely, economic factors are important considerations to make before the set up and operation of any new venture since the factor can either favor or disfavor the concerned business.Social FactorsIt is vital for any new business venture to consider the social aspects of any given market before establishing, marketing, and selling its products in such territories. Evidently, the social trends of a given country might affect its economic trends, business orientation, workforce composition, and the nature of pays. New products require viable social factors. Some social aspects discriminate the sale of some products. This can be evident with the vitamin-enriched bottled water (Morden 86). It is decisive to consider such provisions before trading discriminated products. Studying and understanding the social aspects of a given locality will obviously help the business to make critical decisions on how to establish and operate its business provisions. The sale of products depends on the social beliefs of a given community upon a given commodity. The targeted market segment (athletes aged between 10 and 30) might discriminate the product on social grounds. If prejudicial beliefs disfavor the vitamin-enriched bottled water, its sales will reduce significantly compared to the rest. Before the start up of any business, the owners must consider numerous factors with regard to social provisions. Additionally, the living trends in a given country or locality can also affect the business factors with regard to operations and business ventures.The consumers’ attitude towards the vitamin-enriched bottled water is a subject of social factors. This might affect the sales of the product as it favors others. Thus, it is crucial for the business to consider the consumer perceptions/behaviors before venturing into the business. Such consideration will help the business to know the products to sell, where, and when. Determining the nature of business will also dictate the social provisions necessary for the establishment and operation of a new venture. As a macro environmental factor, social provisions are important in any business following their vitality, applicability, and relevancy in various businesses and territories. The demographic variability will affect the buying trends of customers, and the nature of goods to avail in the market. This signifies the need to consider the social factors of a given environments before introducing the vitamin-enriched bottled water in the market.Technological FactorsThe emergence and ratification of technology has helped numerous businesses to explore varying markets globally. A new venture requires a viable technological provision in the realms of its operations and production of commodities. Technology is critical since it dictates the nature and trend of any business. It will also dictate the marketing and sales of vitamin-enriched bottled water. It is the mandate of the business to consider the aspects of technology since it is relevant to the current competitive markets.

We have all these facts that clearly tell us tap water is better and still bottled water drinkers don’t want to listen. For one, tap water expenses are less than bottled water. Not only the expenses but tap water seems to be healthier for us smart drinkers. Most of all though, just think about the how much harm you bottled water drinkers cause to your body and environment. Therefore, tap water is clearly better for everyone. If you were to sit down and think about it, how much do you think you bottled water drinkers are spending? Research shows that on average, Americans spend 2,000 times more than those who drink tap water. To put that in better understanding, 11.8 billion dollars was spent on bottled water in 2012. (Boesler.) It would be a lot cheaper just to pour a glass at home. Tap water drinkers also can refill their glasses as much as they please, whereas bottled water drinkers must spend more money to buy another bottle. Health also plays a huge role in what type of water you chose to drink. Did you know that most bottled water we drink is really just tap water in a bottle? All water comes from rivers, lakes, streams, and oceans. So bottled water companies are taking this water from these sources, and…show more content…Here’s another fact for bottled water drinkers. Bottles are made from the oil that we put in our vehicles. Just think about how much of that oil is being wasted instead of being used for transportation. My guess would be that if the bottled waters were not around it would probably save us money is gas. The plastic its self is not good for our bodies. If you leave water sitting in the bottle for an extended period of time, the plastic from the water bottle has chemicals that will seep into your water that you bottled water drinkers are intaking every day.

560971fe,1,"#Market Analysis of Bottled Water -   Research Paper ExampleIntroductionIn order to enter the UK market, Ayale’s Herbal Water should take into account upstream and downstream markets and their impact on distribution channel. Physical distribution and channels of distribution are the two basic components of the distribution mix (Herbal Water Home Page 2008). Both deal with physical flows and title flows. The selection of these channels, or routes for reaching consumers, is usually based on sales, communications, and contactual considerations (Crawford 77). The elements of a physical-distribution system include market segments, manufacturing, distribution to wholesaling and retailing points, and transportation and storage links. In order to reach its target market, Herbal Water will use multiple distribution channels.Upstream Value ChainsHerbal Water upstream value chain consists of two main steps: exploration and production. The UK market receives bottled water from primary manufacturers, and distributes through “supermarkets and hypermarkets with a 44.8% share of the market’s volume” (Bottled Water in the United Kingdom 2007). Herbal Water itself is a supplier to food industries, hotels and spas, and cruise lines. The same distribution structure will be used in the UK where Herbal Water can sell its products to natural foods industries, which, in their turn, will sell the water to natural food retail chains delivered the product to the end consumers (Bottled Water in the United Kingdom 2007). In Herbal Water, these activities are designed as a coordinated system and linked with the other elements of the marketing mix (Crawford 72). For Ayale’s Herbal Water, upstream distribution requires the logical design of distribution networks that adapt the transportation and warehousing systems to changing market conditions and variations in other elements of the marketing mix (Hollensen 82).Herbal Water → Danone or Pressure Coolers → Final consumerPotential distributors for Ayale’s Herbal Water are Danone and Pressure Coolers Limited. In the UK, too often, physical-distribution activities are performed as a number of independent functions rather than as a system. In the UK, Danone is one of the potential food companies for cooperation and distribution of Herbal Water products. To plan, direct, and coordinate physical distribution activities, it is desirable for Ayale’s Herbal Water to group them all within a single segment. Manufacturing, however, generally lacks such coordination. Strategic alliance with Pressure Coolers Limited proposes great opportunities for Ayale’s Herbal Water because it is a market leader in bottled water and Pressure Coolers. “Pressure Coolers has been operating for longer than most of its competitors and has dealt with a very wide range of customers across all sectors of industry and commerce as well as almost every part of the public sector” (Pressure Coolers Home Page 2008).The bottled water will be delivered by Herbal Water to the distributor in the UK, Danone and Pressure Coolers, and these companies, in their turn, will distribute Ayale’s Herbal Water through the channels to the end consumers. “Danone is one of the leading producers of fresh dairy products worldwide. Its fresh dairy products division has subsidiaries in 30 countries. Danone’s principal products include yogurts and infant food” (Bottled Water in the United Kingdom 2007). In the UK, business logistics activities for Herbal water will be concerned with the movement and storage of products and supplies to implement marketing strategies and tactics and satisfy customer needs. They focus on coordinating supply and demand and creating place, time, and possession utilities. There is a difference between physical supply and physical distribution, for goods can be moved in two ways (Paley 72). The standard of customer services offered is determined by the consideration of both customers and competitors.Downstream Value ChainsDownstream value chains in the UK are influenced by customers’ needs and preferences, tastes and life style. It is concerned with the physical flow of goods to markets. In order to enter the market, Ayale’s Herbal Water should use two online distributors: Cotswold Spring Pure English Water and Eden Bottled Water Coolers. These companies will distribute Ayale’s Herbal Water through their sites to the end consumers (Doyle and Stern 44). These companies are potential distributors for Ayale’s Herbal Water with large distribution channels and a stable market position.Herbal Water → Online Distributor (Cotswold Spring Pure English Water and Eden Bottled Water Coolers) → Final consumerAlso, in the UK, Herbal Water can sell directly to big retailers. The main retailers in the UK are Tesco and Asda.Herbal Water → Distributor (Tesco and Asda) → Final consumerThis structure of distribution is the most appropriate for the UK market because it allows the company to save costs on advertising and minimize risks (typical for direct distribution channels) (Bottled Water in the United Kingdom 2007). The main channels of direct distribution will be supermarkets, convenience stores, on-trade channels. Improvements in the performance of the physical-distribution functions have led to increased marketing effectiveness and reduced costs for some industries (Hollensen 12). According to statistical results, supermarkets and hypermarkets form the most significant distribution channel in the UK bottled water market, with a 44.8% share of the market’s volume, convenience stores 19.20%, on-trade 13.60%, other 22.40%” (Bottled Water in the United Kingdom 2007). The services offered by major competitors establish a general standard. Nevertheless, Herbl Water management will also think of the particular impact of service variations on customer response and profitability as a guide inconsidering alternative distribution strategies (Hollensen 54). If customers will accept longer delivery times without shifting their business to competitors, then more efficient use might be made of centralized processing facilities, and less efficient ones could be closed. The downstream distribution will cross the legal and organizational boundaries and focuses on an entire process, even though legal control may be in several hands; that is, it is frequently concerned with the linkage of several independent firms like Cotswold Spring Pure English Water and Eden Bottled Water Coolers (Paley 41; Doyle and Stern 28).For Ayale’s Herbal Water, effectively organizing physical-distribution activities in the UK is a difficult task, because it involves such technical matters as transportation rates, materials handling, scheduling movements, and laying out warehouses. Thus, it has general relationships with manufacturing, marketing, and purchasing functions. To develop better flows of goods to customers and consumers, marketing managers achieve a balance of physical-distribution components. In order to meet diverse customers’ needs, Herbal Water should maintain adequate customer service taking into account: (1) the percentage of customers who get their orders in a given number of days; (2) the limitation of back orders to a specified level; (3) delivery to any customer in a specified territory in x days (Hollensen 24). Customer service will also include such components as product availability, delivery reliability and frequency, order-cycle time, and stock-out percentages.Works CitedBottled Water in the United Kingdom.

4df76e52,1,"#The Effect of Plastic Water Bottles on the Environment -   Research Paper ExampleIntroductionIn the past century, environmental issues have been on the center stage as core to man’s existence. The impacts and consequences derived from neglect of the same can be traced as far back as the ice age. Over the past decades, man’s industrious nature has shaken the balance that stood between his environment and the various climatic conditions that prevail in those settings.As such, evils like Deforestation, air, noise and water pollution have been on the rise and consequently pose a threat to our own survival. This could be attributed to the rise in the global population accompanied by rapid technological and industrial advancement. These are among the key factors which have left a negative effect to not only the climate and the ozone layer, but also to our own health.However, in realizing the error of their own doing, nations have come together and put a valuable effort to restore, maintain and manage their respective eco-systems. This study shall look into the environmental implications presented by plastic water bottles. A detailed analysis of relevant literature shall be provided so as to highlight the effects of plastic water bottles to our environment. To this end, solutions on how these effects can be mitigated if not avoided shall also be offered.Emergence of the problemAs the global population continues to grow rapidly, the demand for basic needs such as; food, water, shelter and clothing increases much faster. As such, industries and other providers are under constant pressure to produce and distribute these amenities to the ever demanding populace.Arguably, water is by far the most important resource required by man. To this effect, the sale of bottled water has been seen as a feasible investment attracting lots of profits. However, issues have come up regarding the disposal of the empty bottles after use. While there are various campaigns promoting the proper disposal of plastic bottles, the number of empty plastic bottles polluting our environment is still very high.Effects of plastic water bottles to our environmentThe use of plastic has been very beneficial to mankind. Plastic containers can be used in making durable bottles, packaging and preserving food and liquid substances[1]. This can be attributed to the fact that plastics are water, oil, chemical and sunlight resistant making it the best and economical substance to use in the packaging of perishable and non-perishable substances[2]. Despite these benefits, the amount of plastic bottles pilling up in our waterways and landscapes is alarmingly making the situation a cause of concern.Andrady states that, the environmental effects of empty plastic water bottles do not begin as a result of poor disposal methods but rather, from the manufacturing stage of these plastic containers[3]. In addition, the author states that the creation of plastic bottles requires a lot of chemical pollutants and fossil fuels which contributes to a high percentage of air pollution.To further support this statement, the author asserts that some of the elements used in the creation of plastic contain toxic substances such as benzene and vinyl chloride. These substances have been documented as major causes of cancer and other human and animal ailments and birth defects.In addition, during the production of these plastics, various forms of gases are emitted as well as liquid hydrocarbons which are known to affect the quality of air and soil. To this effect, it is evident that from the beginning, plastics are costly substances to our environment and should be avoided at all costs if the human race is to maintain the already fragile balance that exist between them and their environment.Similarly, Stephenson points out the fact that plastics are durable as compared to other materials used to contain water[4]. The mere fact that it is durable is what makes it a proffered substance in the creation of water bottles. However, its durability also makes it a hazard to the environment. Being durable means that plastic is neither biodegradable nor degradable.To this effect, it means that plastic substances may retain their original form for decades and the only process that affects them is granulation[5]. During this process, plastic substances do not decompose but instead, breaks down into smaller pieces. Animals and even children can easily ingest these pieces which in turn lead to various complications such as digestive problems.In addition, the proponents of plastic use have argued that recycling is an effective method of mitigating the effects of plastic to the environment. Despite their argument, the fact still remains that a recycled hazard is still a hazard. On the same note, the recycling process has detrimental effect on the environment. Andrady confirms that during recycling of plastic substances, synthetic chemical constituents such as ethylene oxide and xylenes among other are emitted[6].Besides having negative impacts on our environment, these chemical substances also cause serious damages to the human immune and nervous systems. In addition, they have been noted as having lasting effects on the blood and kidneys. With this in mind, the unsubstantiated claim that recycling is eco-friendly should be ruled out because it does not address pollution it only delays the inevitable truth.On the same note, Goel states that plastic bottles among other plastic debris have been known to cause serious problems to marine mammals and fish. This he attributes to the fact that these animals often mistake small bottles for prey and end up ingesting them[7]. In addition, small pieces of plastic can also be ingested by fish thereby leading to digestion problems.When these plastic debris’ are ingested, they may lead to blockages in the digestive tract, thereby inhibiting the marine life ability to feed efficiently[8]. Studies indicate that 50% to 80% of turtles found dead are known to have died due to the ingestion of various forms of plastics which lead to malnutrition, starvation and eventually, death[9]. As such, this has resulted to the reduction in the turtle’s population.Furthermore, plastic bottles which find their way into the large water bodies such as rivers, lakes and even the ocean have been documented as a mode of transportation for alien species. Since these bottles can float, they are often carried by the tides to far places. As they float to different regions, there is always a possibility that they carry on them various plant and marine organisms to these non-native marine lives[10].In addition, since the plastics travel slowly, they give the organisms’ ample time to adapt to different water and climatic conditions thereby making them potentially dangerous to the marine life of the host regions. This not only affects the marine environment but may also be hazardous to humans who rely on these waters for their livelihoods.Similarly, burning of these bottles has been known to produce toxic fumes which lead to air pollution. In addition, these fumes when highly concentrated can cause acid rains which affects both plant and animal life. Also, acid rains often degrade the quality of the soil and reduce the oxygen levels in water bodies[11]. This leads to the infection and death of different species of both plants and animals.Fish larvae are highly affected by water pollutants and experience deformities and some times end up dying at a very young age due to the chemical components that shed off plastics. What should be noted in this case is that fish larvae play a pivotal role in maintaining the balance between plant and animal life in the water bodies.As Goel states, they are consumed by other fish and they in turn consume much of the bacteria that if left unchecked may have negative effects on the water bodies. With this disruption of their life cycle, the fish population is greatly reduced and the life of the already existing species is under constant threat of extinction[12].On the same note, Harrison states that fish can be displaced due to the disruption caused by floating debris such as plastic bottles[13]. Whenever fish sense a change in their environment, they often opt to migrate in search of the optimum conditions. Consequently, this disrupts their life and breeding cycles.This unwarranted migration has led to the death of many fish mainly due to infections, being preyed upon and abandonment of eggs which die off due to lack of a favorable environment for breeding. Due to this sad state of affairs, fishermen are forced to overfish from the little that is left. This in turn does not give the remaining fish a chance to repopulate thereby leading to the current situation whereby the demand of fish in the global market far outweighs the supply.On a related note, when plastic bottles are thrown into the storm water drains or the sewerage system, they can cause serious blockages within these drainage pipes[14]. This leads to a situation where water stagnates. Stagnant water smells bad and is a great environment for algal and bacteria blooms.The effects of these microorganisms to the environment as well as our health are well known. Ultimately, the effects that plastics have on the environment are serious and if no serious intervention is carried out, we all may perish from our own actions or lack thereof due to neglecting our environment.Solutions to the problemPlastic is among the worst pollutant in our environment today. The fact that it is a non-biodegradable substance made up of toxic chemicals makes it a great polluter of the earth, air and water[15]. With this in mind, it is a worthwhile endeavor to ensure that the use of this substance is reduced to a bare minimum.The first and most important solution to this problem should therefore be to reduce the use of plastic bottles which will invariably lower its production. However, the implementation of this solution may be tricky since the use of plastic has penetrated in all aspects of our lives.In a bid to reduce the pollution levels caused by these plastic bottles, the governments should implement various environmental friendly strategies to ensure that empty bottles are disposed off correctly. For example, increasing the fines charged for littering may be effective in deterring this habit. In addition, giving punishments such as collecting litter to offenders found littering may serve as an example to others all the while ensuring that all litters are effectively disposed off.In addition, a significant policy is that of Tax rebates which will should be offered to bottlers who use other alternative containers. If such a policy is implemented, it will ensure that the toxic emissions created during the manufacturing of plastic are greatly reduced since this is among the most polluting stages of plastic bottles. In addition to this, all industries manufacturing plastic bottles should be mandated by law to plant trees which acts as carbon sinks thus reducing air pollution levels.Birch and Wachter assert that individuals can do a lot on their own to reduce the carbon footprint[16]. America and China’s population are among the highest consumers of bottled water in the world. It is therefore important that they adjust their lifestyle if they are to reduce the levels of pollution caused by plastic bottles. This can be done by switching to other sources of drinking water like taps or even carrying water in greener containers.The time and money spent by multinational corporations in lobbying for softer legislations on the use of plastic substances would be better spent on research of cheap and safe alternatives. The belief that such alternatives would be too expensive is aimed at discoursing opponents on the use of plastic bottles. There are existing scientifically proven alternatives for plastic but the big players have blatantly refused to embrace these choices.According to Brebbia and Antunes do Carmo, alternatives for some of the substances (e.g. benzene) that cause water pollutions have already been found[17]. However, the authors point out that the prices of these substitutes may be slightly higher than those of the original product. This is because technological innovations are getting more expensive and the extraction and acquisition processes of these substitutes are also costly.The shifts to these alternatives will save these industries millions of dollars in the future and ensure a safer and greener environment for generations to come. It is a fact that consumers will have to deal with high initial costs of the new technology; it is also obvious that this cost would be minimal in comparison to earth without the protective cover or aquatic life. Effects of the use of plastic not only affect the third world.The United States and China have not been spared with hurricanes and floods taking toll on these two nations respectively due to unpredictable climatic changes caused by pollution. In addition, the significant drop in revenue from the fishing industry as well as the decline in the availability of fish indicates that something ought to be done to address this issue of pollution.It is good news to note that action is being taken to reduce the effects of plastics in both global and national fronts; each and every individual has a role to play in conserving the environment and reduce pollution. Miller & Spoolman state that consumers can form the first group of environmentalists by combating the use of these plastics by shunning products composed of chlorine, phosphate, nitrate and polyvinyl compounds[18].Furthermore, they can take their governments to task on proper guidelines regarding the disposal of empty plastic bottles by pressuring the relevant authorities into installing the necessary elements needed to dispose litter. In real fact, the most important weapon we have as individuals is education. In so doing, pollution will decrease and marine life will have a fighting chance for survival and repopulation.Knowledge based solutions to our problems are so far the best techniques[19]. An informed society is likely to understand the consequences of its actions and as such use this knowledge to solve its challenges that it faces daily Individuals must raise their level of interest in environmental issues higher than it stands today.The fact that few people know about pollution leave alone their knowledge on its effects is a grim statistic[20]. Furthermore, few people are aware of the role of the ozone layer, water basins and atmospheric soundness. In response to these sad realities, few people are thus aware of heath risks they are exposed to by the use of these chemicals. Education and awareness still remain the central keys to a healthy future generation of our world.Human nature has a tendency to overlook the problems that do not affect an individual directly. Just relax and take a picture of the earth brown and withered, without the beauty of the green vegetation, and completely barren. This remains the future of our beloved planet Earth, completely brought to destruction by man; the most intelligent creature in existence. When that time comes, there will be no choice of repair.ConclusionThe oceans and other environmental resources have over the years proved to be valuable sources of income, livelihood, food and transport to the human race. However, man’s lack of concern for these resources is increasingly turning into a cause for worry. Poor littering ethics of plastic bottles as well as other forms of pollutants brought about by man’s activity are affecting the quality of these resources all the while impacting negatively on the animal and plant life that depend on these environments for survival.The fishing industry has also learned the hard way that preservation of the water sources is the only key to success in this trade. Low quality fish as well as a decline in the annual volume of fish harvests have in the recent past characterized this once so successful industry.This study has in detail described the sad situation that exists in our environment. Pollution has been noted as a threat to existence and various aspects of pollution brought about by plastic bottles have been discussed. Examples of water, air and earth pollutants such as solid plastic debris, radioactive and chemical substances emanating from the production existence and disposal of plastic bottles have been documented as the leading sources of various forms of pollution.How these pollutants affect all manners of life has also been discussed and the ripple effects of the same to the fishing industry highlighted. While it has been observed that the many nations are indeed directing efforts to mitigate pollution by conforming to the required standards stipulated by the global community, there is still much more that can be done to even better the current scores.It has also been established that the vision for a greener environment can only be realized if the public and private sectors come and work together as a team. Solutions and recommendations have also been made as to how the government and the citizens can contribute in this important task of reducing pollution in future.If implemented, these changes no matter how little will at the end make a vast difference in the lives of many people as well as the ecological balance that supports such existence. It is therefore upon each person to see that they fulfill their roles in this quest in order to secure a greener and safer future not only for future generations, but also for the animal and plant life that depend on the ecosystems for survival.BibliographyAndrady, Anthony.

People who want to keep bottled water think that if bottled water is banned but bottled soft drinks would give off the idea that people should start drinking soft drinks which are worse for consumption. Banning bottled water would not give off that idea. By banning bottled water people would be more likely to fill up their own bottles, thus they would be saving themselves money. Also if bottled water was banned then toxins would not be leaked into the water that they would be drinking. Finally banning bottled water would help to save the lives of wildlife and fish. People believe bottles will not hurt animals or fish but bottles do cause great damage to the environment and damage the ecosystem more than thought to have. Fish lose their kelp habitats to bottles that take oxygen out of the water that kelp and fish need to survive. Animals die due to suffocation from eating plastic water bottles and getting them stuck on there",1

The Food and Drug Administration categorizes bottled water into two subdivisions: Spring or Mineral Water and Non-Spring or Mineral Water. The article “Bottled Water VS Tap Water: an in Depth Comparison” by Filter Butler states that spring or mineral water is, “…bottled water that originates from an underground source which is not part of a community water supply and is fit for human consumption at its point of origin.” While on the other hand non spring or mineral water is, “…bottled water from any source treated for human consumption.” I would have to agree with the article “Why Tap Water is Better Than Bottle Water” simply because most of our bottle water falls under the category of non-spring or mineral water and therefore is held to the same standards as our tap water. So we as people are paying for an ornamental label rather than quality of water most of the time and although we can read the fine print when purchasing bottled water to ensure it is authentic spring/mineral water, most of us do not take the time to do so when we are parched.Subsequently, I studied another article entitled “Should You Drink Tap or Bottled Water?” located in the Health section on Scientific American. The author, House Call Doctor, Sanaz Majd spoke about an encounter she had while leaving the hospital after birthing her twins in which led her to do research on whether tap or bottled water is safer. Her research provided why tap water is preferred by health care professionals and helped me hold a better stance on my position. Like the other two articles revealed, Dr.Majd spoke about the environmental impacts of bottled water, the bacterial content, health risks of the plastic bottles and the inflated costs; but, she brought one thing to my attention that other authors did not. Tap water has stricter regulations. “Bottled water is regulated by the FDA, and tap water by the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). The EPA has tighter restrictions and inspection regimens, while the FDA has a less stringent disclosure of consumer information. The FDA is not requiring disclosure of bottled water sources, treatment processes, and any contaminant reports. If your tap water source is public, however, the EPA is required to send an annual water quality report to its residents disclosing this information.”Keep in mind:  This is only a sample.Get a custom paper now from our expert writers.Get custom essayOverall, I would have to side with tap water.

The article “Bottled Water VS Tap Water: an in Depth Comparison” by Filter Butler states that spring or mineral water is, “…bottled water that originates from an underground source which is not part of a community water supply and is fit for human consumption at its point of origin.” While on the other hand non spring or mineral water is, “…bottled water from any source treated for human consumption.” I would have to agree with the article “Why Tap Water is Better Than Bottle Water” simply because most of our bottle water falls under the category of non-spring or mineral water and therefore is held to the same standards as our tap water. So we as people are paying for an ornamental label rather than quality of water most of the time and although we can read the fine print when purchasing bottled water to ensure it is authentic spring/mineral water, most of us do not take the time to do so when we are parched.Subsequently, I studied another article entitled “Should You Drink Tap or Bottled Water?” located in the Health section on Scientific American. The author, House Call Doctor, Sanaz Majd spoke about an encounter she had while leaving the hospital after birthing her twins in which led her to do research on whether tap or bottled water is safer. Her research provided why tap water is preferred by health care professionals and helped me hold a better stance on my position. Like the other two articles revealed, Dr.Majd spoke about the environmental impacts of bottled water, the bacterial content, health risks of the plastic bottles and the inflated costs; but, she brought one thing to my attention that other authors did not. Tap water has stricter regulations. “Bottled water is regulated by the FDA, and tap water by the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). The EPA has tighter restrictions and inspection regimens, while the FDA has a less stringent disclosure of consumer information. The FDA is not requiring disclosure of bottled water sources, treatment processes, and any contaminant reports. If your tap water source is public, however, the EPA is required to send an annual water quality report to its residents disclosing this information.”Keep in mind:  This is only a sample.Get a custom paper now from our expert writers.Get custom essayOverall, I would have to side with tap water. Not only is it less harmful to the environment and my body but it is not “sugar-coated”.

9a702380,1,"#Ethics of Bottled Water -   Term Paper ExampleIntroductionThe manufacture of bottled water began in Europe in the 1970s. This was because tap water was considered unsafe after the industrial revolution. Its market grew rapidly in the1990s when it became a business venture.Marketers and advertisers promoted it as a symbol of status. Celebrities were seen drinking bottled water during their interviews, concerts, and shows, hence, this further increased its prestige.Moreover, it was used to demonstrate a healthy image. Marketers targeted young people in the gym and sports facilities. Over the years, its consumption has increased making it a household good.It is the fastest selling non- alcoholic beverage according to Doria ( 2006). Different brands have emerged, making its market segment extremely competitive.Similarly, many multinational companies have been created. They extract water from aquifers and springs, package and sell at a competitive price. Some of the leading bottlers include; Fiji Water, Evian, Aquafina, and Dasani among others.The ethics of supplying bottled water have been debated for a long time. Perhaps, this is because water, as a public good has been converted into a private good. Various researchers on the topic, have outlined critical issues facing bottled water.Brei and Bohm (2011) indicate that some communities in the world have no reliable water supply, thus, the consumption of bottled water seems socially unjust. Besides, processing and transporting of bottled water consumes a lot of energy.This energy can be used wisely in other fields of development. Also, crude Oil, a health hazard, is used to make the containers used to transport water, hence; this poses a serious health and environmental issue.In addition, the composition of bottled water has been questioned. According to Brooks et al (2009), a brand of the coca-cola company was accused of containing high levels of bromate (2009).Consequently, it was labeled ‘cancer water’ because bromate enhances cancer. Disposing bottled water containers in a sound way poses a challenge. Consumers dispose water containers carelessly.These containers can be found in social areas and other open spaces. On the other hand, bottled water is convenient. It is easy to carry around, and it can be found in almost all the stores.This paper focuses on the ethics of bottled water by evaluating its effect on water supply and the environment. Furthermore, it examines the ethical effects transforming a public-sector good into a private-sector good.Public goodWater is a public good. This means that it is nonexclusive. The rivers and lakes are national goods while the municipal water systems are communal-public goods.Private supply of such a good is costly because beneficiaries will have to be excluded from enjoying the good. Excluding individuals requires bottlers to process and package it.This process consumes energy in a world where energy is limited. The bottled water culture has caused increased spending on a commodity that should be provided freely.In the past, utility companies and public agencies controlled the market, presently; multinational corporations have privatized water systems for their own benefits.Bottlers are purchasing rights to groundwater distribution channels (Brei and Bohm, 2011). This action makes water, a basic human right into a private commodity.The public is denied access to clean and safe water. Bottled water shifts the attention of the public from the public systems and municipal treatment plants.As a result, the community fails to provide accountability on water issues. In the end, the municipality will have little incentive to improve water infrastructure because they lack support.Consequently, the problem of bottled water will increase because consumers will lose faith in tap water. This problem is made worse when the majority can afford bottled water. In the event that the quality of municipal water decreases, the minority are prone suffer.Cost of Bottled WaterBottled water is expensive to produce. Gleick and Cooley in their article “Energy Implications of Bottled Water” claim that it requires 2000 times more energy compared to tap water (2009).Water bottles are made from a thermoplastic polymer. The material used contains energy, and more energy is used to transform the material into bottles (Gleick and Cooley, 2009).Bottled water requires energy to run the machinery and equipments used for processing and packaging. The primary source of bottled water is municipal water or groundwater.Municipal water can either be bottled without further treatment or bottled after further treatment. Further purification of water requires energy (Gleick and Cooley, 2009).Besides this, energy is required to transport bottled water and refrigerate it before it is sold. This further depletes the limited fossil fuel available globally. For example, Fiji water supplies millions of bottled water to the United States daily.The cost of transport is reflected in the final cost. According to Gleick and Cooley, production of water bottles consumes over 50 million barrels of oil in a year.This oil is enough to supply the needs of the United States for almost three days. Apart from the cost of energy, bottled water hinders development, thereby costing the community.In some regions, individuals work in water companies to produce water for other countries. However, in their homes, the water they consume is not clean.For example, Fiji supplies over a million bottles of water to the United States daily. Nevertheless, most people in the Fiji struggle to obtain clean water.Environmental Effects of Bottled WaterBottled water disposal has presented a crucial waste management problem. Thousands of plastic bottles are carelessly disposed by consumers every day. Out of these, a small percentage is recycled while the rest is disposed in landfills.To make it worse, some of these containers end up in rivers, lakes and other water bodies. Water bottles do not attract the deposit for recycling offered to soda and beer bottles (Brooks et al., 2009).Disposal of plastic bottles pollutes the soil because the chemical composition of plastic takes years to decompose. If these bottles are burnt, the chemicals released into the air cause pollution.Similarly, when exposed to high temperatures, these containers release harmful substances. When these chemicals are released into the ecosystem, they cause cardiovascular and gastrointestinal ailments to human beings. Consequently, the chemicals released such as dioxin, contribute to acid rain and global warming.Convenience of Bottled WaterAlthough bottled water poses waste management challenges, it is exceptionally convenient. Distributors view that transporting small bottles are convenient, as opposed to bulk containers.In addition, consumers consider it pure compared to tap water. Tap water may be pure at the water plants, but after passing through distribution pipes, the water becomes contaminated.Besides, tap water is associated with bad taste and odor (Doria, 2006). Doria in his article “Bottled Water Versus Tap Water: Understanding Consumers’ Preferences” asserts that consumers prefer bottled water because of its ‘organoleptic’ characteristics (2006).Consumers also consider the fact that if contamination is discovered; the bottler will act more efficiently than the government in neutralizing the problem. Purity and contamination are not the only convenient facts about bottled water. Doria (2006) notes bottled water saves time and energy.Buying water indicates that consumers have less time to fill their own containers (Brei and Bohm, 2011). The availability of bottled water allows consumers to buy water when they need it. It saves them from carrying a container of water everywhere. Moreover, the consumer can dispose the container after consuming the water.Solutions to Bottled Water ProblemsThe cost of bottled water, by a larger degree outweighs its benefits making it a problem. Bottlers and producers of bottled water do not consider the cost of disposing the containers.This means that the taxpayer has to cover these costs (Brei and Bohm, 2011). One solution to this problem is to order the bottlers to pay for the cost of disposal.Given that pollution taxes will reflect on the consumer price, the price of bottled water will increase while the demand decrease. With less people buying bottled water, the environmental effect will reduce.Secondly, water containers can be washed and re-used again to ease pollution. Thirdly, bottlers can use local facilities for production instead of transporting water from far- away locations.This will reduce the price of bottled water and the amount of energy used for transportation. As a public good, government and local institutions can deal with bottled water by defining limits between what is viewed as public or private.This means that companies will no longer have to extract water from springs or aquifers and sell. In addition, the government should set sanctions for companies which violate these rules (Brei and Bohm, 2011).For this to work, the government needs the cooperation and participation of the public. However, rather than trying to reduce the problem of bottled water, public water should be made clean.The government and policy makers should replace old pipes and modernize public water plants. This will ensure consumers drink clean, affordable water. If tap water is safe, then bottled water will only be a luxury.ConclusionBottled water may be cheap and convenient, but in the long run, it has a high environmental cost. Its consumption of energy is 2000 times that of tap water. Moreover, its disposal causes water, soil, and water pollution.Plastic containers end up in landfills where the bottles take up space, since the material used for their production is not biodegradable. However, despite its energy and environmental implications, bottled water is seen as socially unethical.This is because bottled water turns a public good into a private commodity. As a social good, water should be available to everyone instead of being sold at high prices.The other reason that makes bottled water unethical is when it is sold to communities who lack a dependable source of water. For example, some communities in Africa face famine yet water are sold in other regions of the same country.In my opinion, it is wrong to sell water while people are drying. It is also unethical to sell water because it is a human right and not a good sold to individuals who have the money to buy it.The assumption that bottled water is purer is not necessarily true. According to Doria (2006), this assumption should not be generalized because it depends on salient cases. For this reason, tap water is socially, environmentally and morally ethical as opposed to bottled water.",1

Drinking water is an essential to all living beings, especially human beings. The concern globally is people are not getting enough water to help replace whatever they have lost through the normal bodily functions. Bottled water has great contributions when it comes to Americans. Americans of this century have grown up on bottled water; it becomes second nature to them to not buy bottled water. At schools a majority of kids have to drink out of water fountains. The water in the water fountains has to travel through rusted pipes. Pipes can contain leach copper and lead; some water treatment plants are not designed to remove toxins, such as, medications, human excretion, and even drugs people let wash down drain pipes. Parents do not realize what contaminants could be in a water fountain. Taking a bottle of water to school could help solve this issue, and also from being their kids possibly getting dehydrated. Seeing as kids only get a “1, 2, 3” count to drink after recess. Bottled water is seen in generally all convenience store, grocery store, and vending machines.

Did you know that one hundred billion dollars is spent every year on bottled water? Not only does bottled water itself add to unnecessary waste it also adds the excessive waste of money in your wallet, it’ll cost you about a thousand times more to buy bottled water than drink tap water. Buying a sixteen ounce bottle of water for about a dollar would equal to about seven to eight dollars a gallon, where as if you were to drink tap water at home it wouldn’t cost as much probably more or so less than ten cents, But if you were to drink a bottle of water every single day of the year it would equate to about $365 dollars, which is ridiculous to think about when it comes to buying water. You could just buy a filter for your faucet at home if you wanted the taste of bottled water for only about a one-time purchase of $40 dollars. Tap water always has a different taste depending on the region your from because of where the water filter is built on, like in Austin where the whole city is built on limestone so you could partially get a taste of limestone. Tap water can hold it’s own in a taste from the described experiments happening in such places as New York, Boston and California. When asking people to drink three unidentified water samples and asking for which one of these taste good to them many people selected tap water, as a surprise because not many people would think that tap water would taste similar to bottled water.The safety concerns about tap water are up to EPA standards, but the fears about tap water are perfectly reasonable. Only about 10% of all tap water in the United states don’t meet up to the standards of the Safe Drinking Water Act, which sets the regulatory amounts of containments provided by the public water systems in your area. The standards for tap water and bottled water are the exact same except for the fact that tap water is subject to reporting standards and also whoever is reporting it has to detail where the water is being obtained from of course. Bottled water also doesn’t have to disclaim or announce where their water is coming from. The scary thing about bottled water compared to tap water is that even if the bottled water plants fail to meet federal safety standards they could still sell the water and nobody would notice a thing until they have to label the bottle “contains excessive bacteria”. In 1999, the National defense council tested 1000 bottles of water from 103 different brands and found that about a third of them, at least one sample was over the allowable limits for synthetic organic chemicals, bacteria, and waste. In 2008 Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality, “Some microorganisms that are normally of little or no public health significance may grow to higher levels in bottled water.” Tap water compared to bottled water to an environmental standpoint indicates that tap water can get areas with water scarcity. Bottled waters bottles themselves are made from a type of plastic called polyethylene terephthalate, or PET. It releases many chemicals in air including nickel, ethyl benzene, ethylene oxide, and benzene. According to a study in 2007 just producing the bottles by themselves cost about 17 million barrels of oil. Fossil fuels used to create bottles also create greenhouse gases. Only 31% of bottles are recycled completely and the rest are left in landfills or get burned releasing all those deadly chemicals again. Tap water has stated some facts and they’re very scary and eye opening when compared to bottled water, but now bottled water has a turn to state some facts and defend itself and show why its on equal standing with tap water.Bottled water as a whole is more convenient to the people.

With bottled water you have many choices to choose from and many sizes to choose from and there are many factors that go into choosing a water bottle brand that you want to drink such as taste, quality and convenience. There have been many improvements in the composition and makeup of a bottle of water. Bottling companies have started using less PET plastic to make single serve water bottles! They’ve also lessened the weight of the bottles of plastic, which means that there have been a savings of 3.3 billion pounds of PET resin since 2000. Bottling plants have now started to make use of the recycle PET to make bottled water containers. Which means that less energy is used to make the bottles, which require less fossil fuel to burn and which also equals less greenhouse gases! Now bottles are now completely 100% recyclable and is also to be recycled multiple times so that’s a progressive step in the right way!Bottled water is also very convenient when a natural disaster happens because when a natural disaster happens in an area the tap water and natural water might be contaminated and now undrinkable.

There have been many improvements in the composition and makeup of a bottle of water. Bottling companies have started using less PET plastic to make single serve water bottles! They’ve also lessened the weight of the bottles of plastic, which means that there have been a savings of 3.3 billion pounds of PET resin since 2000. Bottling plants have now started to make use of the recycle PET to make bottled water containers. Which means that less energy is used to make the bottles, which require less fossil fuel to burn and which also equals less greenhouse gases! Now bottles are now completely 100% recyclable and is also to be recycled multiple times so that’s a progressive step in the right way!Bottled water is also very convenient when a natural disaster happens because when a natural disaster happens in an area the tap water and natural water might be contaminated and now undrinkable. Bottled water is very useful in many retrospect’s it can be delivered to countries in need of help from a disaster or just plain poverty. Bottled water is trying to be better for the world but it’s a very slow and progressive process but it’s working slowly. Bottled water has some nasty information about it when compared to tap water though unfortunately. Even, though companies are trying to make bottles recyclable usually only 1 out of every 5 get completely recycled. That’s a step in the right way but there are so many more steps to go. Bottled water also uses 17 million barrels of oil a year just to produce bottles and apparently that much oil is enough to supply a year’s worth of gas for one million cars. The bottled water company also is a huge industry compared to tap water. The bottled water industry is worth about 63 billion and that’s just insane considering tap water cost $.015 cents to the gallon.Keep in mind:  This is only a sample.Get a custom paper now from our expert writers.Get custom essaySo in the matter of Bottled water vs. Tap water, I’m slightly biased towards tap water because of the benefits it has on the Earth and the wallet, but unfortunately I’ll still drink bottled water because its extremely convenient and I believe it taste better.

So, let’s just all agree water is amazing.Bottled water as a whole is more convenient to the people. You can have one at the gym, you can have one at work, you can have on at the playground, and you can have one anywhere! The health concerns about bottled water are contrary to the things you might hear! Many bottled water plants use public water sources! Except when they arrive at bottling plants they have several processes that need to be fulfilled. The process includes reverse osmosis, distillation, micro-filtration, carbon filtration, ozonation, and ultraviolet lights, then placed in a bottle under sanitary conditions and sold to the consumers! So it’s perfectly safe to drink so don’t worry about that! There are differences between tap water and bottled water; Public water systems provide quality water for human consumption and other uses! Public water systems are granted exclusive rights to provide water to areas within its range so people don’t really have control over that!

You wouldn’t believe the amount of water bottles that are wasted and how the cost has made a change.In the article “Water, Water Everywhere --in Bottles” it shows how many different brands of water started to now show in stores.It uses facts, and data collected over the past few years . It states how buying water could grow more than buying soda. People would start to value bottle water more than soda.

fc23928e,1,"#Informative Essay On Bottled Water -   Internet Public LibraryBottled water is something that I drink daily. I have at least 8 bottles every day, and most days I drink many more. So, when posed with the question, ""Would you buy less bottled water if you knew the facts about its production and impact on the environment, and why?"", I am forced to think about my own consumption of bottled water. In general, I like to think of myself as a pretty environmentally conscious person. I avoid using harmful chemicals in my home, and use natural alternatives whenever possible. I plant flowers around my home to help the declining bee population. I have reduced the amount of waste that my household produces, and I make sure to recycle whatever I can. I even refrain from eating meat because of the meat industry's negative environmental impact,…show more content…The presence of chlorine, fluoride, and heavy metals in tap water is scary. The lead-contaminated water crisis in Flint, Michigan made my fears of consuming tap water much worse. It has been over two years, and the people of Flint are still without safe water. This beings said, I feel safer consuming bottled water than I do consuming tap water. However, I do look for safer alternative to bottled water if they are available. For instance, there is a safe, tested, natural spring about 30 minutes away from my home. If I am close, I will fill up a few jugs of water and drink that instead of bottled water. Or if I am at someone's home that has a high quality home water filtering system, I do not mind drinking the water. I have even looked into a filtering system for my own home, but most are just not affordable. On the rare occasion that I do find one that seems affordable, the filtering is not up to my standards. Springs are not always close by, tap water tastes bad and contains harmful chemicals, and filtering systems are expensive. So, bottled water is my default choice for these reasons.",1

Ever since the beginning of time, water has always been an imperative part of our lives for hydration. Even though, it is an important source of hydration, tap water is not as good as bottled water. Water fountains are often neglected by cleaning staff, you can find gross things which makes the tap water dirtier than bottled water. Also, we have to worry about pipe problems,  the pipes of the water fountain can possibly break or get contaminated with bacteria which can poison students. According to Annie Leonard, the author of ""The Story of Bottled Water,""  tap water is better than bottled water. I disagree with Annie Leonard, because bottled water…show more content…The first way it is more convenient is that all students can have their own and they won 't be late to class for waiting their turn for waiting for a drink at the water fountain. You may think that students could just go to class and wait or quickly walk another drinking fountain, they could, but most students already don’t want to go to class, so waiting for their turn at the water fountain just gives them another excuse for being tardy, with bottled water, students have no excuse. Also, water fountains might take a while to construct, because of the cost and having to connect it to different pipes, this means that there may not be another water fountain for students to go to. Bottled water is given in a way that makes it possible for every student to have their own water. With each student having their own bottle they will not have to consistently ask to leave the class to get water from the water fountain, because they can just go into their backpacks and not miss out on any instruction or part of the lesson. According to recent studies, middle and high school students who are frequently missing class are less likely to graduate than their peers. Yes, most of the time students are only out of class for 4-5 minutes, however those 4-5 minutes can add up to 4-5 school days. Bottled water will only let students out of class when they have to fill up their bottles, but it is more likely for those minutes to add up to less than half a school day. Students can have tap water in a bottle water form if they use a reusable bottle, however young kids are forgetful. ""The brain only chooses to remember relevant things  to your life.""

A shocking fact that many consumers are probably not aware of is that twenty five percent of all bottled water comes right from municipal water tap sources, from cities all over. It’s difficult for consumers to notice the taste difference between spring water and refined tap water as companies re-purify and/or add minerals to the water. (McGrath). Consumers are sold by the claims of natural, pure, wholesome water, but aren’t always receiving those benefits.Say no to plagiarism. Get a tailor-made essay on'Why Violent Video Games Shouldn't Be Banned'?Get original essaySamples of bottled water from large companies such as Aquafina and Dasani were used in a large study, among one hundred and three other brands of bottled water conducted by Natural Resources Canada, this study only resulted in even more disturbing, shocking facts pertaining to the bottled water industry. The study concluded that ""about one-third of the waters tested contained levels of contamination including synthetic organic chemicals, bacteria and arsenic”. (Canadian Dimension)If bottled water companies continue their profit oriented ways, and nothing is done to prevent the water being sold to consumers as ""pure, natural, purified and filtered"" when there is a large chance that statement is not fully truthful, the companies will continue their dirty ways. In order for bottled water companies to compete with the ""taste"" of tap water, extra ingredients are added to the bottled water. These extra ingredients companies put in may include: calcium, magnesium, and possibly salt, in minimal amounts. (Stanek)Deception of what a product consists of is another business oriented tactic used by companies. Take bottled water giant Poland Spring for an example. It’s safe to assume that a majority of all Americans have seen what the label of a Poland Spring water bottle looks like, with the ""Natural Spring Water From Maine Since 1845"", written on a banner in front of a stream flowing in between a group of trees. The deceptive part of this is the label itself. When a consumer sees the visual of a lush stream within a group of trees, and below the picture is a banner with ""Natural Spring Water From Maine Since 1845"", chances are the company just earned another sale. Yes, there truly is a spring in Maine called ""Poland Spring"", but it is no longer the source of Poland Springs bottled water, since 1996. That’s over ten years ago and most people still are left to believe that they are buying water from a ""Poland Spring"" in the state of Maine. Poland Spring is still allowed to say that their water is from Maine, but there are multiple springs, (roughly three different spring sources) located up to thirty miles from the primary spring. (McGrath)The Food and Drug Administration follows the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to regulate bottled water. However, due to the Food and Drug Administration’s status as a federal government agency, only thirty to forty percent of bottled water being sold across state lines can be monitored. In conclusion, a large sixty to seventy percent of bottled water being sold within a single state, is not included in that previously mentioned regulation that is enforced under the Food and Drug Administration’s Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. For the water that falls into the group that is chosen to be regulated under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the requirement for testing the water being used for bottled, is very minimal. Once per year, bottled water, with the exception of carbonated bottled water, is checked for chemical, physical, as well as radiological contaminants. Adding to the already minimal safety checks on the integrity of a ""wholesome water"", the Food and Drug Administration has just one, yes one single full time worker employed to over watch the bottled water testing. These two factors, with minimally checking the integrity of the water being used in bottled water, only occurring once per year, and the absolute bare minimum amount of workers that are full time, who knows what could be slipping through the cracks. Hopefully nothing too serious before it’s irreversible. (The Progressive)Even with a majority of bottled water operations being looked at by the Food and Drug Administration under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, officials who are working within the bottled water industry itself are not saying or promising that bottled water is a safer alternative to tap water, otherwise known as municipal tap water. In fact, the president of the International Bottled Water Association, Joe Doss, adds: ""We think drinking water, whether it’s bottled or tap water, is a good thing. I will not state that bottled water is healthier."" Doss also points out that: ""It just boils down to what consumers prefer."" (Springen) If the president of what is the largest representation of bottled water, on an international scale publically acknowledges this, and practically confirming that bottled water isn’t cleaner than tap water, why are so many companies still trying to sway and persuade consumers into purchasing their product by making them think that they are going to be drinking something of higher quality?The issue of whether or not bottled water is truly wholesome, and ""pure, natural, purified, filtered"" doesn’t just apply to the water itself. Let’s say that there are two different brands of bottled water, side by side, both from the same source. Both brand A and brand B collect water from a shared source and bottle it, selling it as ""pure, natural, purified, filtered.."" but when an independent research group decides that they would like to verify and test the truth behind those claims, they find that brand A has water that is more contaminated than the water brand B is selling. Why might this be? The water bottle itself! Companies should not be given the OK to bottle water, regardless of how pure it is, because in the end, the ""pureness"" of that water in the bottled could be compromised from the chemicals and materials that leech into the water over time or pressure from the bottle itself. With an average of twenty six billion water bottles consumed by Americans in one year, and only about fourteen percent of those bottles being recycled... Think about all of the chemicals from the plastic that could be risking the health to the American Consumers that purchase the bottled water regularly and consume it, and also its negative impact on the environment once it is melted down for recycling. The Food and Drug Administration requirements say that companies need to be testing a minimum of four empty plastic water bottles on a tri-monthly basis. This testing is required due to the possibility of a bacterial contamination. A fairly disturbing piece of information just to add on top of all of this, is that the Food and Drug Administration does not currently have a specific requirement for bottled water companies to make the sample/quality testing results with the public and the consumer group. On the other hand, municipal water providers are required by the Food and Drug Administration to make this information available for all to see. (The Progressive)Some people argue that nobody is forcing consumers to purchase either bottled water or water from the tap. While this statement is completely true, consumers should not have to be scammed by false advertising of a product, regardless of what that product may be. When a product has information provided about it, and the consumer reads that information, it should be truthful. Just because there is less enforcement on the operation and distribution of bottled water, companies should not be trying to take advantage of it. One solution to this problem is to mandate that all water suppliers, both municipal/city tap water sources, and bottled water sources release water testing results to everyone on a monthly schedule. The outcome of this is a more informed consumer group. For the companies and suppliers themselves, there is a chance that by keeping consumers and potential consumers informed, sales might even begin to increase because there would be less frustration and confusion from having to guess what the actual quality of the water being consumed is.Keep in mind:  This is only a sample.Get a custom paper now from our expert writers.Get custom essayIn the end, the choice is ultimately up to the consumer, just as Joseph Doss, the President and CEO of the International Bottled Water Association stated.

(The Progressive)Even with a majority of bottled water operations being looked at by the Food and Drug Administration under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, officials who are working within the bottled water industry itself are not saying or promising that bottled water is a safer alternative to tap water, otherwise known as municipal tap water. In fact, the president of the International Bottled Water Association, Joe Doss, adds: ""We think drinking water, whether it’s bottled or tap water, is a good thing. I will not state that bottled water is healthier."" Doss also points out that: ""It just boils down to what consumers prefer."" (Springen) If the president of what is the largest representation of bottled water, on an international scale publically acknowledges this, and practically confirming that bottled water isn’t cleaner than tap water, why are so many companies still trying to sway and persuade consumers into purchasing their product by making them think that they are going to be drinking something of higher quality?The issue of whether or not bottled water is truly wholesome, and ""pure, natural, purified, filtered"" doesn’t just apply to the water itself. Let’s say that there are two different brands of bottled water, side by side, both from the same source. Both brand A and brand B collect water from a shared source and bottle it, selling it as ""pure, natural, purified, filtered.."" but when an independent research group decides that they would like to verify and test the truth behind those claims, they find that brand A has water that is more contaminated than the water brand B is selling. Why might this be? The water bottle itself! Companies should not be given the OK to bottle water, regardless of how pure it is, because in the end, the ""pureness"" of that water in the bottled could be compromised from the chemicals and materials that leech into the water over time or pressure from the bottle itself. With an average of twenty six billion water bottles consumed by Americans in one year, and only about fourteen percent of those bottles being recycled... Think about all of the chemicals from the plastic that could be risking the health to the American Consumers that purchase the bottled water regularly and consume it, and also its negative impact on the environment once it is melted down for recycling. The Food and Drug Administration requirements say that companies need to be testing a minimum of four empty plastic water bottles on a tri-monthly basis. This testing is required due to the possibility of a bacterial contamination. A fairly disturbing piece of information just to add on top of all of this, is that the Food and Drug Administration does not currently have a specific requirement for bottled water companies to make the sample/quality testing results with the public and the consumer group. On the other hand, municipal water providers are required by the Food and Drug Administration to make this information available for all to see.

Just because there is less enforcement on the operation and distribution of bottled water, companies should not be trying to take advantage of it. One solution to this problem is to mandate that all water suppliers, both municipal/city tap water sources, and bottled water sources release water testing results to everyone on a monthly schedule. The outcome of this is a more informed consumer group.

There will always be companies who are more honest and have better marketing practice than others in the way that they convey a product to a consumer, but the true solution to this is to mandate increased publishing’s of quality reports.Deception of what a product consists of is another business oriented tactic used by companies. Take bottled water giant Poland Spring for an example. It’s safe to assume that a majority of all Americans have seen what the label of a Poland Spring water bottle looks like, with the ""Natural Spring Water From Maine Since 1845"", written on a banner in front of a stream flowing in between a group of trees. The deceptive part of this is the label itself. When a consumer sees the visual of a lush stream within a group of trees, and below the picture is a banner with ""Natural Spring Water From Maine Since 1845"", chances are the company just earned another sale. Yes, there truly is a spring in Maine called ""Poland Spring"", but it is no longer the source of Poland Springs bottled water, since 1996. That’s over ten years ago and most people still are left to believe that they are buying water from a ""Poland Spring"" in the state of Maine. Poland Spring is still allowed to say that their water is from Maine, but there are multiple springs, (roughly three different spring sources) located up to thirty miles from the primary spring. (McGrath)The Food and Drug Administration follows the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to regulate bottled water. However, due to the Food and Drug Administration’s status as a federal government agency, only thirty to forty percent of bottled water being sold across state lines can be monitored. In conclusion, a large sixty to seventy percent of bottled water being sold within a single state, is not included in that previously mentioned regulation that is enforced under the Food and Drug Administration’s Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. For the water that falls into the group that is chosen to be regulated under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the requirement for testing the water being used for bottled, is very minimal. Once per year, bottled water, with the exception of carbonated bottled water, is checked for chemical, physical, as well as radiological contaminants.

aad77d57,1,"#The Consequences of Using Tap and Bottled Water -    Written by Cynthia R. Haller, the article ‘Walk, Talk, Cook, Eat: A Guide to Using Sources’ presents a dialogue between a student Marvin and a professor. Marvin is interested in the topic of water pollution and intended to compare the consequences of using tap and bottled water. To research this issue, he needs credible sources. In the article, ‘Walk, Talk, Cook, and Eat’, I was impressed by the professor’s response to Marvin: “you might think about using sources such as walking, talking, cooking, and eating” (Haller 195). Using the word ‘walking’, the professor means searching for the required information, while ‘talking’ is a dialogue with the authors of the sources. ‘Cooking’ is implementing the information in the paper to achieve new conclusions, and ‘eating’ implies allowing the sources to change the perspective. This comparison appears to be an illustrative example, of how to apply sources in a paper correctly.Therefore, the article appeared to help understand how to conduct research appropriately and write a high-quality paper on its basis. It supplied a precise explanation, which is highly likely to prevent the most common mistakes in writing assignments. In addition, the methodology is easy to be understood by a reader, as it is presented in the form of a conversation between a student and a professor. Thus, the article provides a solution for numerous students, who are puzzled by the requirement to apply sources for their assignments. I would use the method of ‘Walk, Talk, Cook, Eat’ for completing the writing tasks in my course, as it is a useful guide, on how to make appropriate research for papers in various fields.The provided materials on finding and applying sources present a helpful guide and cover all the details of this process. I have got acquainted with the criteria of reliable and informative sources, which can be applied in various fields. All the articles and books should match the following requirements: currency, relevancy, authority, accuracy, and purpose (CRAAP Test). Moreover, it is crucial to follow the rules of formatting while implementing a source in a paper. Each course should have correct citations and be included in the list of bibliography (Annotated Bibliography).",1
dc0259a0,1,"#How To Ban Bottled Water In Colleges  ipl.orgSeveral colleges and universities have banned the sale and distribution of bottled water on their campus. In these instances, bottled water is allowed on campus, but the college has decided that the institution itself, will not sell or distribute bottled water on campus. Hope College currently does not have such a policy. However, Hope College should follow the footsteps of the other colleges and start banning that sale and/or distribution of bottled water on campus. Even though this policy would possibly take away a student’s ability to choose, a basic human right, if the student body voted to ban the sale of bottled water on campus. In turn, this ban could be only for on-campus sale of bottled water. If there is need for bottled water for…show more content…It may be possible that students will begin drinking more of the unhealthy beverages, and thus increase the chance of obesity. However, at this moment, Hope College already barely sells bottled water. When one looks at the dining areas, one can notice that there is barely any bottled water for sale. A majority of the Hope College distributes water from pop machines. Certainly, there are still about two locations on campus that have in stock a small amount of bottled water for sale. However, it is such a minor amount, that the removal of such items would not affect the students to much. At the same time, the removal of bottled water on campus, would save the college money that could then be used towards other programs to benefit the students. Nevertheless, the complete removal of bottled water on Hope College’s campus, even though small, would be another step towards the entire world helping save the world.

Tapped, Filmed and directed by Stephanie Soetchig, is a documentary examining the bottled water industry. In July of 2009, Tapped was released to the world. Tapped follows the bottled water industry in order to find out why water is becoming a commodity. In this film they first talk about how it started and who started it, Nestle. The film encourages people to really think about why we are paying for water. You can tell right away what this film is doing. This film is pulling on your heart strings, but using irrelevant numbers in order to grab your attention. Tapped can use these numbers for the rest of the world, but when you really see what these numbers mean you really start to realize tapped is not completely right. ""By 2030, two-thirds of the world will be lacking access to clean drinking water."" According to who? This may seem like a fact, but truly it is a theory. Lets find the truth about bottled water and how it really helps the world and the people on it.…show more content…One, bottled water is tap water. The main point of Tapped pointing out this fact is to show that you can get tap water free and should not have to pay for it. Two, later in the film they suggest that they find all kinds of harmful substances in bottled water, what does regulation of bottled water have to do with health if 40 percent of it is tap water",1
78b74dbd,1,"#Marketing of the Bottled Water Industry in the US -   Coursework ExampleThe bottled water industry has seen enormous growth in the past couple of years in the United States. The industry has appeared to be booming even though many people wonder as to why a commodity which offers something that is freely available in every person’s house would be bought at a more costly rate from some gas station or outlet. The bottled water industry is hence associated with a high standard of living and a comfortable lifestyle (Bottled Water: A Symbol of U.S. Commerce, Culture, 2007). So marketing a product which depends highly on people’s perception of its need is a very tricky affair to handle. The growth of the industry can then be attributed to the level of comfort that people have become accustomed to.The ease of accessibility to the bottle eventually leads up to its sale. If the placement of bottles is obscure and difficult to get to then it becomes extremely difficult to make any sale. Keeping this in mind the water bottle industry aims at making their product highly accessible and easy to get a hold of. People would purchase bottles rather than waiting to get home or their destination to get a glass. Besides that with the increasing emphasis of people towards health, many people prefer drinking bottled mineral water as it boasts of purity and nutrition (Demographics, 2001). The relative ease in accessibility with the abundance of gas stations, retail outlets and overall stores which stock bottle water beside other beverages has made the selling of bottled water easier.Since we have determined the placement part of the marketing mix we must now consider the other factors before deciding whether investing in a bottled water company is feasible or not. The pricing of these bottles of water is relatively low but even then it cannot beat price of the public water provided which is free. Thus, conflict arises whether buyers would wait to get home rather than purchase a bottle of water. This leads us to consider the buyer behavior. As far as American market is concerned the people have modest incomes and can easily afford life’s luxuries (bottled water being a luxury as even obtaining regular unprocessed water is a problem in most countries). Therefore, Americans can afford to buy water if they feel the slightest bit thirsty. For any other country it would be very difficult to persuade people to buy water when it is freely available but in the United States this is not a problem. Usually when people decide to buy a bottle of water it is because they are in transit and want a portable source with them during their trip. Bottled water provides them that utility. Health conscious people get their peace of mind that the water they drink is pure, the go-getters and active people have a source of water on hand whenever they are thirsty and people who do not wish to drink carbonated sodas and other caffeinated drinks at restaurants and eateries have a healthy alternative on hand.The competitors in the U.S. are numerous and are from both local and international competitive classes. Existence of Nestle bottled water and Pepsico’s Dasani can be counted as international competition whereas smaller brands such as Evian cater to local states requirements. The entry and exit into this market is also relatively easy and getting a slice of market share is also easy. The proper marketing campaign and the perfect gimmick can help emerging companies profit from sales.This leads us to proper branding and product image. If the brand name is trust inducing and appears to provide what they promise then the profits from the business venture could turn out to be astronomical (Karolefski, 2002). Since water isn’t manufactured the overall cost of production is zero. The costs required are for extraction and bottling. The major costs are of labor, machinery, buildings, distribution and promotion. These costs exist in every other industry along with the manufacturing cost. Here the manufacturing cost is missing meaning more capital for investment in promotions (Centre for Agribusiness and Economic Development).The bottled water industry is a feasible option for investors who would like to concentrate in countries which have a high income per capita and are progressive. The U.S. industry is both the things. In my opinion it would benefit investors to concentrate on this industry. Though it is also important to note that they must have a strong marketing team to manage to capture the market from existing competition. The brand image, the product placement, the pricing, and the product itself must uphold consumer confidence because if the organization fails to fulfill their promises then the consumers would shift from them to any of the other numerous brands available.",1

That means that it takes more than 17 million barrels of oil to produce these plastic bottles. In my opinion, I think that tap water is more safe for us to drink and also, more safe for the environment. Human Safety is one of the major problems with bottled water and tap water. Bottled water does not contain any toxins or chemicals that are bad for humans. Bottled water does not make tap water toxic if poured in. It also has to go through many different processes to make it good for us. Another one of the major problems of bottled water is all the resources used to make the bottle. Like I said before, it takes about 1/4 of the bottle filled with oil just to make the bottle. It also takes around 3.4 mega joules of energy to make a typical one-liter plastic bottle, cap, and packaging.…show more content…Almost eight out of ten end up in a landfill or incinerator. Also, Hundreds of millions end up as litter on roads, beaches, streams, and other waterways. Taxpayers pay hundred millions of dollars each year in disposal and litter cleanup costs. In conclusion, tap water is the better choice over bottled water. Bottled water has to go through so many processes to make it safe for us to drink. It also takes so much of our resources, some including fossil fuels, to make the bottle, which does not seem right. We have to spend money to dispose bottled water that people discard and",1

Experience and observation shows a lack of self-preservation by denying oneself of basic needs (Biali). With today 's harried lifestyle, convenient resources are a must. Bottled water consumption is on the rise, quickly becoming the epitome of convenience. According to Beverage Industry, ""In 2015, total U.S. bottled water consumption grew by 7.9 percent to 11.7 billion gallons, up from 10.87 billion gallons in 2014"" (“Bottled Water Sees Accelerated Growth, Consumption”).   The benefits of bottled water outweigh the benefits of tap water because of bottled water 's convenience, cleanliness, and healthfulness.  Bottled water is convenient in multiple ways.  Versatility allows water consumption…show more content…While it is true environmental concerns are an issue, the bottled water industry is not to blame. “Bottled water’s environmental footprint is the lowest of any packaged beverage. In fact, all containers are 100% recyclable and many companies are already using recycled plastic bottles"" (“Bottled Water Sees Accelerated Growth, Consumption”). Instead of demonizing the bottled water industry over litter and plastic-laden landfills, perhaps, directing the touts toward lax recycling efforts will bring about progress (Cullen). What it all boils down to is bottled water is a well utilized resource that many are tapping into, whether it is for the convenience, the cleanliness, or the healthfulness bottled water provides. Some people prefer to drink from a bottled rather than the tap because of convenience. Other people, do not have the luxury of clean water spewing from the tap and turn to bottled water as a clean and healthy water source. Water is a most basic need and whether people are drinking from a bottle by preference or a way of life, bottled water is",1

You just came back from a run and you are really thirsty, should you drink from the disgusting water fountain, or should you buy a water bottle from the vending machine? To some people water fountains are gross, yet they are better for the environment, cheaper and the water is healthier. Whereas, plastic bottles contain many harmful chemicals. That is why 75% say that tap water is better.  First, bottled water is bad for the environment. For example, 80% of bottles go to landfills where they sit for 450 years before they decompose! Also, in many places, public water…show more content…For example, there are high amounts of phthalates. BPA is also included. BPA is a concern to many people because exposure to it can cause possible effects on the brain and behavior. However, bottled water companies are trying to reduce the amount of chemicals. Do you remember the last time when you left your water bottle outside when you were playing and when you came back to have a drink, the water was all bubbly and warm? What really happened is that the plastic that the bottles are made of might have endocrine disruptors when exposed to too much heat. Endocrine disruptors are harmful, and they may interfere with the body’s endocrine system and produce conflict with development. On top of that, with the BPA that is inside the water may potentially lead pregnant women to low birth weight.Another example is that plastic bottles are expensive. Have you ever thought of how much bottled water industries pay to make the bottles? Well, Néstle pays three dollars for every million litres that they make, when we pay one to two dollars for 1 bottle! Also, did you know that bottled water is two times the price of tap water! Since last year, Néstle bottled water sales have increased to four hundred million dollars! At home, you can drink tap water that is almost",1
637f01df,1,"#Environmental impact of bottled water -    Bottled water is the new wave of the future as millions of people are purchasing it everyday while disregarding its environmental and cultural impacts to the society. Currently, the impacts of bottled water are spanning various policy formulation and enforcement strategies. Hall notes that there is an increased consumption of bottled water as several companies have carried out massive investments in this lucrative industry (para.1).Consequently, this increased consumption has led to major problems of waste management. Landfills are increasing to huge sizes and the rates of recycling the used containers are still miserably low. The non-environmental friendly ways of disposing the plastic bottles has only served to escalate the problem. Therefore, as an aspiring environmentalist, I feel that the uncontrolled use of these products have dire environmental consequences that need to be addressed.A number of key “players” are responsible for escalating the problem. To begin with, manufacturers of plastic water bottles play a significant role in this detrimental issue.The process of manufacturing the water bottles, such as the dependence on fossil fuels, is causing a lot of direct as well indirect destructing to the environment. In most cases, the raw plastic materials for making the bottles are heated to very high temperatures before putting them into bottle-shaped blow molds. And the source of energy needed to achieve this high temperature is derived from either electricity or natural gas.The amount of energy needed to achieve this is also usually very high. The Pacific Institute estimates that “it takes around 3.4 mega joules of energy to make a typical one-liter plastic bottle, cap, and packaging” (para.4). The same corporation also estimates that the more than 30 billion liters of bottled consumed in the United States every year requires over 17 million barrels of oil to manufacture, besides the energy used in their transportation.Usually, these heat sources are obtained from the non-renewable fossil fuels. Most plastic bottles are manufactured from polyethylene terephthalate and it contains two compounds: terephthalic acid (PTA) and monoethylene glycol (MEG). These constituents of PTA are toxic compounds that are obtained from fossil fuels. Therefore, in the process of production of the plastic bottles, some of them can leak into the atmosphere leading to serious environmental impacts.In addition to the manufacturing process, the transportation of the manufactured plastic bottles also has serious environment effects. Besides consuming a lot of energy, the use of trucks, trains, or any other means of transportation, leads to pollution of the environment.More over, to maintain the quality of the bottled water, they have to be provided with additional packaging and cooling systems, which also increase the amount of energy used in their transportation. To say plainly, the environment is being deteriorated by the uncontrolled manufacture of plastic bottles (Andrady, 126).Consumers of bottled water are another key “players” in this problem. Most of them hold the false perception that bottled water is superior to other types of water. The manufactures of bottled water are doing good business nowadays because consumers think that bottled water has a better taste and real or alleged health benefits.For example, in a Field Institute 1990 survey, it is reported that “about half of the consumers surveyed said that they drank bottled water because it tasted better than water from the tap, about one-fourth gave safety and health reasons, and one-fourth believed that bottled water was free of contaminants” ( LaMoreaux, 122).However, it is important to point out that this is a false conception of the consumers who want to justify falsely their addiction to bottled water while disregarding its impacts to the beautiful environment. More so, the consumers have been blinded by the false adverts of the companies selling bottled water.In fact, investigations have revealed that bottled water is not any superior to tap water and when consumed in excess it can lead to health problems, for example, teeth problems. Interestingly, research has also established that some of the blends of bottled water are more contaminated than even the normal tap water and some of the bottled water are repacked tap water.The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation estimates that “between 2002 and 2007, the world consumption of bottled water had increased by 7.6 per cent per year, from 130.95 billion liters to 188.8 billion liters” (para.1). The U.S., consuming over billion liters, is the world’s greatest consumer of the product.Individuals usually consume bottled water because of a number of reasons. First, it offers them the convenience they need, especially when travelling and they have to move from one place to the other. Second, some individuals use it as a luxury item and they purchase it to show off their privileged status in the society.Lastly, some individuals think that bottled water is of better quality as compared to tap water. However, what causes Mother Earth pain is that the plastic bottles are discarded without considering their impacts. Consumers are not aware of their roles as environmental stewards. This has been caused by inadequate education on the impacts of improper disposal of the plastic bottle containers.The problem that bottled water pose to the environment also involves the various policy makers who have failed to institute workable solutions to solve this problem. As much as numerous researches have revealed that the manufacturers of bottled water are simply luring the consumers with their attractive ads, not much has been done on the part of the policy makers to address this problem. Many ‘innocent’ consumers are daily falling prey of these attractive ads.It has been proved that some of the bottled water is not obtained from natural or protected sources as claimed, but they are simply purified water that has been obtained from the same source as the ordinary tap water. More so, the so-called “spring water” is also at risk of being contaminated, unless adequate measures are taken to prevent this. The contamination can arise from natural pollutants that sometimes get into the water as it moves to the surface.A number of side-by-side taste experiments have revealed that there is no clear distinction in aspects of quality of taste between municipal water and the water that has been distilled. However, as much as the policy makers are aware of these facts, they have failed to advise the consumers accordingly in this regard. That is why most consumers have developed the false perception of the superiority of bottled water. Consequently, issues of environmental stewardship have been swept under the carpet.It is of essence to note that this problem is an outcome of various historical factors. As pointed out in the earlier sections of this paper, several divergent views have been held over time by end-users of bottled water. To be particular, they have perceived that this water is superior to others and that none other can match its quality.Nonetheless, this historical belief has led to ineffective disposal methods of the plastic bottles that are now changing the beauty of this world’s environment. Historically, the recycling of bottled water has never been recognized as the best option of tackling this problem. From the time when the plastic water bottles were introduced, less focus was put that someday there will be a need of recycling them so as to conserve resources.The fruits of this historical negligence are evident today as few areas in the United States have endorsed bottled water-recycling programs. Many manufacturers have realized this historical mistake and they are now making recyclable plastics. However, despite these, most of them still end up in landfills or are left to dirty the corners of streets.Similarly, the current state of the problem is also due to bottled water-recycling program that has remained unchecked for a while now. This has led to the low level of recycling containers that has dropped in comparison to the other years.For example, in 1994, the overall recycling rate of all recyclable plastic containers was 15 % but by 2003, the level had dropped to 19 %. According to the Container Research Institute (CRI), nearly 40 million bottles of used plastic containers do no end up in the recycling plants on a daily basis (CRI, para. 1).This low recycling rate of plastics is leading to increased consumption of fossil fuels as well as increased environmental degradation. In the United States, some domestic plastic recycling companies have recorded decreased returns as more used plastics are being exported to other countries that have historically held the culture of recycling them.The impacts of bottled water on the environment are felt in almost every place in the United States. Notable, however, is that the extraction of bottled water from groundwater stores has raised the concern that the supply of water to the residents is decreasing in such places.When bottled water companies extract a lot of water from the underground reserves, it causes stress to the ecosystem because of the reduced availability of this precious commodity that is vital for sustaining life. Key places where this problem has been reported include “Texas, Florida, and the Great Lakes Region” (Aitchison, 4).Aitchison records that “when flows and levels of a region’s springs, wetlands, lakes, streams and rivers are materially affected from extraction for bottling, the entire local and even regional environment suffers” (para.6). This is the consequence in places where too much mining of water for bottling purposes is practiced.Since bottled water is categorized in terms of being a “food” under federal legislation, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the bottled water industry and it requires all bottle water manufacturers to check for contaminants at least once every week to ensure that the consumers are safe.Besides putting a check on the quality of bottled water, it is also beneficial in conserving the environment, as it is indicative of a company’s commitment to environmental issues. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the federal agency that is endowed with the responsibility of ensuring that the country’s environment is sustainable. The EPA enforces the regulations of the government concerning destructive habits on the environment.For example, EPA enforces the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA), which focuses on “industry, government, and public attention on reducing the amount of pollution through cost-effective changes in production, operation, and raw materials use” (“Summary of PPA”, para.1).In addition, the agency enforces pollution prevention strategies that include practices that “increase efficiency in the use of energy, water, or other natural resources, and protect the resource base through conservation efforts” (“Summary of PPA”, para. 3). The PPA has been involved in tackling this problem.Appertaining to waste management, EPA has been engaged in countrywide campaigns to sensitize people about the dangers of improper disposal of wastes. In particular, the agency has been “challenging all citizens to conserve their natural resources by committing to reduce, reuse, and recycle at home, in the community, and at the office” (“Wastes,” para.1). In addition to the initiative that has been taken by EPA, there are a number of proposed policies that are aimed at addressing the problem.For example, the manufacture of biodegradable plastic water bottle has been suggested to be the best alternative option of tackling this problem. This is because they are both environmentally friendly and economically viable. Even though the biodegradable bottles are only able to disintegrate under certain special conditions, such as adequate exposure to heat and humidity, they are able to disintegrate within three months under these special conditions.This is a much better option in contrast to the plastic bottles that may take an extended period to be entirely degenerated. In addition, the biodegradable containers have been proved to be free of harmful substances, reusable, and consume less energy during manufacture (Environmental leader, para. 2)This problem posed by bottled water containers to the environment fits into the larger field of study of environmental issues that I will be entering into. In this age, man has shown subjugating influence on the environment.The beauty of Mother Earth is slowly fading away as humanity has adopted an oppressive stance toward nature. Therefore, the best method of protecting the environment is by shielding it from destruction. As an inspiring environmentalist, this issue of ensuring that plastic bottled water containers do not destroy the environment will fall in my immediate docket.The study of such environmental issues will adequately equip me to fulfill this role of conserving the environment so as to ensure that the natural resources are preserved for future and for the present generation. More so, since currently the world is shifting to a new era in which environmental issues are increasingly getting more attention, my study of this subject will be of great importance.In conclusion, the consumption of bottled water has serious environmental impacts that should be addressed. The various key “players” such as manufacturers, consumers, and policy makers ought to develop realistic ways of solving this problem.As much as the problem is associated with some historical factors, concerted efforts should be made to reduce the impact of bottled water containers to the society. Adoption of such measures would ensure that there is efficiency in waste bottle disposal. As an inspiring environmentalist, I will strive to this end.Works CitedAitchison, Christin. “Bottled Water and Water Shortages.” Suite 101. 2008. Web.Andrady, Anthony. Plastics and the environment.
